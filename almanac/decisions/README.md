# Decisions

This folder records the architecturally meaningful choices behind Proto-Familiar — not what the
code currently does (the [Architecture](../architecture) pages cover that), but why it is shaped
this way, what alternatives were rejected, and what a future change has to respect or
deliberately reverse. Each page states a status: **decided and shipped**, **decided but not yet
implemented**, or **proposed**. A "proposed" or "not yet implemented" status is not stale — it is
the page's honest record of how far the decision has actually traveled from conversation into
code.

Sixteen decisions live here. Grouped by the question each one answers:

## Naming and module identity

Three modules in [Architecture](../architecture) are named after brain structures on purpose, and
the naming conversations doubled as design conversations about what each module is and is not
allowed to do:

- [Naming Thalamus: mediator, not generator](thalamus-naming) — why the inward-facing context
  module is named after the brain's relay structure, not a generic "context builder."
- [Naming Cerebellum: executes, does not decide](cerebellum-naming) — the motor-structure name
  for the outward-facing action module, and the executes/decides boundary it encodes.
- [Eury as the agent's identity](eury-as-agent-identity) — how the project's reference identity
  became the concrete default other design decisions are checked against.

## Safety and proactivity

- [Proactivity over caution](proactivity-over-caution) — the incident that put a standing rule
  against "bias toward staying quiet" language into every prompt that decides whether the
  Familiar acts.
- [Trust tiers gate reads, not writes](trust-tiers-gate-reads-not-writes) — why Village's
  category/grant system only ever controls what a session can be told, never what it can write
  into memory, and how that differs from `injection-guard.js`.
- [Voluntary and autonomic lanes in Cerebellum](cerebellum-consent-lanes) — a proposed,
  not-yet-built consent distinction for any future feature that continuously renders
  Familiar-side state outward.
- [Single-user before platform](single-user-before-platform) — the founding scoping decision that
  bounds Village and every multi-channel surface to one ward's own support network rather than a
  general multi-user platform.

## The Initiative build spec: wait-streak and contact rhythm

A connected sequence of passes that gave the Familiar a self-observed sense of its own waiting
and of what is normal for its bond with the ward:

- [Wait-streak experiment](wait-streak-experiment) — Pass 0/1: removing pre-resolved "nothing is
  wrong" axioms from the warm reach-out prompt, and the neutral wait counter that replaced them.
- [Contact-rhythm baselines](contact-rhythm-baselines) — Pass 2: computed median/p90/longest
  contact-gap statistics per weekday-class, so a silence can be read against what is actually
  ordinary for this bond.

## Memory, Tomes, and memorization

- [Session memorization: durable server-side queue](session-memorization-queue) — why session
  memorization was rebuilt from a fire-and-forget client call into a durable, resumable
  server-side queue.
- [Tome multi-writer merge policy](tome-multi-writer-merge-policy) — a proposed, not-yet-built
  reconciliation policy for a Tome receiving writes from more than one source.
- [Per-feature model routing](per-feature-model-routing) — letting the ward bind each background
  LLM job to its own saved connection instead of one shared provider.

## Operating rules applied across components

- [Exact values are code's job](exact-values-in-code) — the rule that any machine-correct value
  (a timestamp, a UID, an RRULE) is computed by code and only ever referenced by the model, never
  produced by it.
- [Elapsed-time macros read stored history, not `Date.now()`](time-macros) — the concrete
  instance of that rule for `{{elapsedTime}}` and `{{timeSinceLastSession}}`.
- [Prompt-cache-aware context ordering](prompt-cache-aware-context-ordering) — the static-prefix
  / dynamic-depth-injection split in `thalamus.enrich()`, and the usage-exhaustion incident that
  motivated it.
- [Local process over VM/Docker sandboxing](local-process-over-vm-sandboxing) — why every
  autonomous loop runs inside one continuously-running Node process instead of a sandboxed or
  lazily-woken alternative.

See [Architecture](../architecture) for the system these decisions constrain, and
[Concepts](../concepts) for the design stances (entity-as-subject, armature, devoted-companion)
several of them are built to serve.
