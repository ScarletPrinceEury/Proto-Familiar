# Core Prompts and Multi-Surface Assembly

The ward's four core prompts — System Prompt, Character Profile, User (Human) Profile, and
Post-History Prompt — are ward-authored configuration fields that define how the Familiar
should behave and who their bonded human is. `core-prompts.js` is the single server-side module
that assembles these four prompts into a messages array, and every surface — web, Discord,
voice, and any server-initiated turn — routes through it, so the Familiar's configured
personality and stance are present no matter which surface a conversation started on
[@core-prompts-js]. This module exists because an earlier version of the system assembled the
four prompts only in the browser, which meant every server-initiated surface answered with no
configured identity at all; that incident, and the lesson it left for any future cross-surface
capability, is recorded below.

## The Four Core Prompts

The four core prompts are ward-authored configuration fields, not the identity block stored in [Phylactery](phylactery) [@core-prompts-js]:

1. **System Prompt** — the standing instruction for how the Familiar should behave
2. **Character Profile** — who the Familiar is (their personality, voice, values)
3. **User (Human) Profile** — who their bonded human is
4. **Post-History Prompt** — the standing instruction that rides *after* the conversation (often used to gate certain behaviors or set priorities that only matter once the context is clear)

These are separate from the `enriched.static` block (the Phylactery identity layer: base instructions, self, ward, relationship, and custom files). That layer covers *what the system knows*; the core prompts are *how the Familiar should behave* — they are personality and stance, authored by the ward in settings [@core-prompts-js].

## How assembly works today

**`core-prompts.js`** is the one server-side assembly path, and it exports three functions [@core-prompts-js]:

- `coreSystemSegment(settings)` — builds the three system-level prompts (System Prompt, Character Profile, User Profile) in a fixed order, with fixed headers (`[Character Profile]` and `[Human Profile]`) and a fixed separator (`---`), matching the order the web client itself renders. It resolves `{{user}}/{{char}}` macros the same way `applyNameVars` does on the client, so a configured name appears in place of a literal token. It returns a string, or an empty string when no prompts are configured (so `.filter(Boolean)` drops it cleanly).
- `postHistoryMessage(settings)` — builds the post-history prompt as its own message (role is ward-configurable, defaults to 'system'). Returns a complete message object `{role, content}`, or null when unconfigured.
- `withCorePrompts(messages, settings)` — folds the core prompts into a bare messages array: the core system segment LEADS (prepended before the conversation), and the post-history message TRAILS (appended after). This is the function called by the `/api/chat` endpoint when `injectCorePrompts` is set [@core-prompts-js].

`/api/chat` carries an `injectCorePrompts` flag [@architecture-doc]. When set (voice sets it; the web client still builds prompts itself, on its own established path, so they don't double), the endpoint calls `withCorePrompts` to inject them before sending to the model. The order matters: the core segment leads, so a static prepend via [Prompt-cache-aware context ordering](../decisions/prompt-cache-aware-context-ordering) lands in front of it (static → persona, matching the web order), and the post-history message trails the conversation [@core-prompts-js] [@architecture-doc].

`discord-gateway.js` folds core prompts into both its live and revisit paths [@discord-gateway-js]. The Discord adapter resolves settings and calls `withCorePrompts`, so Discord text (whether a live `handleTurn` or a cached `revisit`) assembles them the same way voice and the web do [@discord-gateway-js].

## Why a server-side path exists: the client-only assembly incident

Before v0.11.0-alpha (PR #274), the four prompts were assembled solely in the browser. The web client's `_buildApiMessagesInner` function in `public/app.js` constructed them and POSTed them inside the messages array [@app-js]. This worked for web chat, but every server-initiated turn — Discord text via `handleTurn + revisit`, voice calls via `voice-chat-turn.js → /api/chat` — used a bare messages array with no browser to assemble them [@core-prompts-js]. The Familiar answered Discord and voice with none of its configured identity. The reported symptom was: "my Familiar doesn't see the user prompt at all on Discord."

The bug was architectural, not a typo: there was exactly one path that assembled the prompts, and it lived in the browser. Server surfaces had no mirror. The fix was the three changes described above — `core-prompts.js` as the server-side mirror, the `injectCorePrompts` flag on `/api/chat`, and `discord-gateway.js` calling into the same function — landing together as v0.11.0-alpha.

## Ground Truth, Not Reconstruction: Prompt Capture

The prompt inspector revealed a deeper problem during the same incident: it was a client-side reconstruction, showing what *should* have been assembled based on the web client's state. It could never show server surfaces' payloads, and it showed intent, not reality [@prompt-capture-js].

**`prompt-capture.js` records the actual message array sent to the model, per surface, at the send boundary** [@prompt-capture-js]. Instead of the inspector reconstructing "what should be in the prompt," it captures "what actually left the building":

- `recordOutgoingPrompt(surface, {messages, model, provider})` — records the exact payload for a surface (web, voice, discord, discord-revisit, etc.), overwriting the previous capture. It is best-effort: capture must never throw into a turn, even if the inspector is broken.
- `lastOutgoingPrompt(surface)` — retrieves one surface's latest capture (or null), so the inspector can show ground truth for every surface, not just the web path [@prompt-capture-js].

The inspector's UI now tabs by surface. Each tab shows the actual message array that reached the model on that surface, not a reconstruction. When the Familiar reported not seeing its core prompts on Discord, the inspector would have shown exactly that — an absent system segment — instead of cheerfully displaying prompts that never left the browser [@prompt-capture-js].

## The Lesson: Cross-Surface Capabilities Need Server Cells

This bug generalizes to a rule: **any prompt component assembled client-side is invisible to every server-initiated surface (Discord, voice, background loops, future surfaces).** When a capability crosses the browser/server boundary, the server needs its own assembly path, or the feature silently vanishes off-web [@core-prompts-js].

This mirrors what CLAUDE.md calls vision RULE C: a capability must either land in the shared turn path, or the spec must name which surfaces carry it. The four core prompts were a web-only assembly with no server cell, so they vanished on every other surface [@core-prompts-js] [@architecture-doc].

The corollary for observability: an inspector fed by "what should be assembled" cannot catch a payload it never sees. Ground truth must be captured at the send boundary, not reconstructed from intent.
