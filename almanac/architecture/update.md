# Update

Proto-Familiar can update itself against the repository or branch it came from, without any manual git or download steps. The system detects available updates and applies them through either a web UI popover or a Discord command, never restarting the server automatically — the ward always chooses when to restart and load the new code [@updater-js] [@app-js] [@discord-gateway-js].

## Two update modes: git vs download

`updater.js` ships with two update strategies, detected from the install shape [@updater-js]:

**Git checkout mode** — the repo is cloned with `.git` present. Update keys off `origin` (or a fork's own remote) and the checked-out branch, reading them live from git. The check is `git fetch` + compare versions, and application is `git merge --ff-only` (refusing a merge that would rewrite history) [@updater-js]. This strategy is repo-agnostic: a fork tracks the fork's branch, an upstream clone tracks upstream, without any reconfiguration.

**Download mode** — the install came from a release archive (no `.git`). A download has no git history and no record of where it came from, so update keys off the `repository` field baked into `package.json` instead [@updater-js]. Update is download-and-replace: fetch the latest source tarball from GitHub and lay its files over the install. This needs **no git on the machine** — only `tar`, which ships in the base OS on macOS/Linux and Windows 10+. Git requires Xcode tools on macOS, which non-technical users don't have [@updater-js].

The `PROTO_FAMILIAR_UPDATE_BRANCH` environment variable can override the default branch in download mode [@updater-js].

Both paths **never restart the process** — new code is live only after a restart, which the launcher or update scripts handle (and re-run dependency install). The caller tells the ward to restart via the web UI button or Discord command outcome. User data is safe by construction: the tarball contains only the repo's tracked files, so gitignored data (`settings.json`, `tomes/`, `logs/`, the Python venvs, `node_modules`) is never in the source and is never overwritten or deleted [@updater-js].

## Update detection and status reporting

An in-memory `_updateState` object caches the result of checking for available updates, keyed to the repository and branch [@app-js]. The `/api/update-status` endpoint returns `{ available: boolean, current: string, latest: string, behind: number, dirty: boolean, where?: string }`, where `where` is a human-readable branch or tag name [@app-js]. A request with `force=true` bypasses the cache and re-checks immediately [@app-js].

On the web, an `update-dot` indicator appears in the header when `available === true`, and clicking the update button opens a popover showing the version gap and "Apply Update" prompt [@app-js]. The popover displays the repository URL parsed from the upstream for context [@app-js].

## Discord `/update` command

Ward-only (checked at the call site; a villager typing `/update` is just chat). The `/update` command with no arguments reports status — `An update is available...` or `You're on v..., N commits behind` — and refuses if the tree has uncommitted local changes (checked via `git status`) [@discord-gateway-js]. The `/update now` variant applies the update and reports `The new code is on disk. Restart the server (or use your launcher) to load it.` [@discord-gateway-js].

## The update API

`POST /api/update` triggers `applyUpdate()`, which runs the relevant strategy (git merge or tarball download/replace) and writes the outcome to a return object with `{ ok, current, latest, error? }` [@updater-js]. A failed update logs the full error but returns a structured failure to the client, never throwing into the response path [@updater-js].

## Off-switch

Hard off-switch: `PROTO_FAMILIAR_UPDATE_DISABLED=1` disables the entire subsystem [@updater-js].

## Design principle: manual, never automatic

Update is never automatic and never silent. Detection runs on demand (via `/api/update-status`), not on a background loop. A ward who has disabled updates can go weeks without seeing an available update notice. The system respects this: updates are opt-in ceremonies, not surprise background work. The ward chooses the moment to restart and load new code.
