# Session Memory Extraction

Memory extraction is the process of calling an LLM to transform a chat transcript into structured memory facts and relationships. The extraction pipeline is owned by functions in `src/memory/memorization.js` that shape how a transcript is presented to the model, how the model's voice is framed, and how speaker attribution works. [@memorization-js]

When a memorization job runs (see [Session Memorization](session-memorization) for queue mechanics), the extraction pipeline assembles the transcript, calls the provider, and parses the response. This page explains the architectural layers that make extraction reliable: role-faithful message assembly, voice framing, the three-layer attribution fix, and speaker name handling.

## Role-faithful transcript assembly

The conversation is assembled as a proper message array with real OpenAI roles, not as a flattened "Name: text" blob inside a prompt. [@memorization-js]

`conversationMessages(messages, {sharedRoom, wardLabel, withNames})` [@memorization-js] transforms the session's message list into role-tagged turns:

- The Familiar's own lines become `assistant` role messages.
- Everyone else becomes `user` role messages.
- In shared rooms (where 3+ humans are present), an inline `[Name]:` prefix or ward label stays on each user message, because only three chat roles exist — all humans collapse to `user`, so inline labels are the only disambiguator for multiple people.

`buildExtractionMessages({instructions, messages, sharedRoom, wardLabel, withNames})` [@memorization-js] assembles the full provider message array:

1. A leading `system` message with the extraction instructions (the prompt).
2. The conversation as role-tagged turns from `conversationMessages`.
3. A neutral `system` closing cue: `EXTRACTION_CLOSING_CUE` [@memorization-js].

The closing cue is deliberately not first-person. It re-anchors "now extract" as a task directive so a transcript ending on a human line cannot tempt the model to reply as if continuing the conversation instead of extracting. It is task plumbing, not something the Familiar says, so it never puts the Familiar's voice in a role that is not theirs. [@memorization-js]

Why this matters: giving the model real roles lets it natively read which lines are the Familiar's own — where early `about_me` extraction used to go wrong, because the model could not reliably tell which parts of the flattened blob were the Familiar speaking.

Dating is unaffected: a memory's day comes from the job's calendar day (via `segmentByDay` and `date_key`), never from parsing the transcript itself. [@memorization-js]

## Voice reframe

Both extraction prompts (`buildPrompt` and `buildSharedRoomPrompt`) [@memorization-js] are framed as the Familiar's own notes, with careful attention to timing:

- The prompt opening is now timing-agnostic: "Ah, some unprocessed session logs…" instead of "I just finished talking." The old wording was wrong for the memory-sweep loop and batch imports, which run the same extraction prompt over past days that are no longer "just finished."
- A plain correctness caution grounds the task: "This is a form of tool call: the memorization only works if the syntax is flawless." This is safe because no tools are attached to the extraction request, so the phrase cannot make the model emit a real tool-call structure.
- The prompt bookends are punchy and JSON-focused: "My notes read —" to open, "ONLY the JSON" to close. [@memorization-js]

The voice reframe distinguishes the ward-private extraction (`buildPrompt`) from the shared-room variant (`buildSharedRoomPrompt`). Ward-private extraction assumes the Familiar will keep facts about everyone; the prompt instructs the Familiar to use proper first-person voice and asks for careful attribution. Shared-room extraction runs when strangers are present and assumes a separate consent step will filter — the prompt explicitly tells the Familiar to record facts without pre-censoring and to let consent handling do the gating. [@memorization-js]

## The attribution stack — three reinforcing layers

A reported bug in early versions: the Familiar saved memories crediting the ward with actions other people did. Not a data bug (speakers are tagged in the transcript) — the model's strong prior that "the user = the person I serve" was overrunning weak attribution guidance. Three reinforcing layers now address this: [@memorization-js]

1. **Subjects + the "Whose fact is it?" rule:** The first rule in both extraction prompts is stated in the `{{user}}` macro (a concrete name tracks better than "my human"). "Only what {{user}} did is about {{user}}; someone else's action is about THEM even when {{user}} relays it." Facts are named in the `content` field (using proper voice) and the `subjects` list (naming the actual actor), never with {{user}} as the actor when someone else did the deed. Correct `subjects` also routes third-party facts to the consent "ask" path later, tightening privacy gating. [@memorization-js]

2. **Role-faithful transcript** (described above): Fixes the Familiar-vs-others axis, so the model can natively read which lines are the Familiar's own.

3. **Name-field speaker handles** (described below): Fixes the ward-vs-other-humans axis by stamping each turn with a first-class sender ID.

These three layers resolve attribution whenever the transcript makes the actor identifiable. They do not close every case: a `"you"` or a bare pronoun in someone's words can still point at either the ward or whoever they were addressing with no way to tell from the turn itself. [Attribution confidence: degrade the attribution, not the fact](../decisions/attribution-confidence-degrades-not-drops) covers what the extraction does with that residual case — mark the referent unresolved, emit an optional `attribution_confidence` on the fact, and let recall and a later noticing sweep carry the correction instead of guessing or dropping the fact outright.

## Speaker name field handling

The OpenAI `name` field lets the model get a first-class sender identifier per message turn, not only the inline `[Name]:` text in the message content. But the field has constraints that make it tricky to use with real names.

As of 0.11.109-alpha (PR #406) this machinery lives in a shared root module, `name-field.js` (beside `llm-call.js`), not inside `memorization.js`. The ward asked for the same name-field policy to apply across every surface that puts a person's turn in a `user` role, not just the memorization worker, so it was extracted into one shared implementation instead of copied per surface. `memorization.js` imports from `name-field.js` and re-exports the same names for back-compat, so existing callers and tests that import from `memorization.js` keep working [@memorization-js] [@name-field-js].

The rollout landed in two further passes, 0.11.110–0.11.111-alpha (PR #408 for the server-side surfaces, PR #409 for the browser). Every server + browser surface that puts a person's turn in a `user` role now stamps names through this shared module: memorization (the original caller), the live web chat path (`/api/chat`, covering both web chat and voice), Discord, voice, and the browser tome-writer. See [Per-surface integration](#per-surface-integration) below for how each surface wires in [@server-js] [@discord-gateway-js] [@voice-chat-turn-js] [@app-js].

### The constraint

OpenAI validates the `name` field against `^[^\s]+$` — no whitespace or non-ASCII. A bad value returns a 400 error for the ENTIRE request. Real names (spaces, unicode) are exactly what breaks it. [@memorization-js]

### Code-minted name-safe handles

Every speaker gets a code-generated handle via `speakerNameField({role, speaker, wardName, material})` [@name-field-js]:

- **Villagers or strangers:** `slugifyLabel(name)` — the name slug-cased, guaranteed name-field-safe.
- **The ward (a user turn with no speaker field):** `ward-<slug>` — the `ward-` prefix marks the bond and makes the ward a specific person, never flattened to a bare role. The slug preserves their name.
- **Material with no live speaker (an archived log on a user turn):** `session-archive` — so it cannot be misread as someone addressing the Familiar.
- **The Familiar's own assistant turns:** None (the role carries them; no name needed).

### Capability detection and learning

Whether to use name fields is gated by `nameFieldEnabledFor(job, settings)` [@name-field-js], which follows a three-tier fallback:

1. **Explicit per-connection setting:** The ward can set `nameFieldCapable: 'yes'` or `'no'` on a connection. This wins.
2. **Learned per-provider-model:** A cache keyed `` `${provider}:${model}` `` records what earlier calls taught: if a previous call succeeded with names, try names again; if a previous call got a 400-with-names that succeeded without names, skip names.
3. **Optimistic:** If nothing is known, assume the provider supports names and attempt it. Learn from the outcome.

The learned verdict now persists to disk, in a cap-cache file keyed `provider:model` (`tomes/.name-field-capability.json`) — the same shape as the vision capability cache described in [Vision capability defaults to BLIND; prove capability via allowlist](../decisions/vision-capability-defaults). Persistence gets the ward two things for free: the verdict survives a server restart (no re-learning every boot), and a model change is a new cache key, so the field is re-attempted on a model swap without a separate "model changed" check. Persistence is OFF until `hydrateNameFieldCache()` runs at server boot (called from `server.js`), which loads the file and turns on write-through; tests never call it, so `recordNameFieldResult` stays pure in-memory there and no stray cap file is written during a test run [@name-field-js].

### Graceful degradation: `withNameFieldFallback`

The function `withNameFieldFallback({withNames, buildMessages, callProviderFn, onLearn})` [@name-field-js] implements the retry strategy (its canonical name; `memorization.js` re-exports it as `extractWithNameFallback` for back-compat [@memorization-js]):

- Attempt extraction with names enabled (if `withNames` is true).
- On success, record `'yes'` in the learned cache.
- On a 400 error while names were on, retry ONCE without names. If that succeeds, record `'no'` in the cache — the provider does not support the field. If it also fails, propagate the second failure untouched (never mis-learn).
- On non-400 errors, never retry — propagate immediately.

This design mirrors the `visionCapable` learning pattern in [Vision capability defaults to BLIND; prove capability via allowlist](../decisions/vision-capability-defaults). The net result: names switch on for capable providers with zero configuration. A strict server costs one wasted attempt, then stays bare. Memorization never fails over the name field itself. If a third capability cache appears elsewhere, that is the signal to extract one shared cap-cache helper — two small parallel copies (vision, name-field) don't yet earn the abstraction [@name-field-js].

`sendWithNames({job, settings, messages, wardName, send})` [@name-field-js] is the one-call seam a non-streaming surface uses instead of wiring `withNameFieldFallback` by hand: it resolves the policy (the shared off-switch `PROTO_FAMILIAR_NAME_FIELDS_DISABLED=1` → the ward's per-connection tri-state → the learned verdict → optimistic), stamps the messages with `stampNamesOnTurns`, and runs the same fallback and learning step. The caller's `send(messages)` must throw an error whose message contains `"returned 400"` on a name-field rejection, which is what triggers the bare retry [@name-field-js].

### Per-surface integration

Every surface resolves to the same policy and the same code-minted handles, but each wires the fallback differently because each surface calls the provider differently:

- **Memorization** — unchanged in behavior; it is the original caller, now routed through the shared module instead of its own copy [@memorization-js].
- **`/api/chat`** — covers both web chat and voice, because the voice turn (`runVoiceTurn` in `voice-chat-turn.js`) POSTs to `/api/chat` rather than calling a provider directly. Its turns are the ward's (villagers arrive over Discord, not this endpoint), so they resolve to `ward-<slug>`. See [the non-uniformity note](#the-one-deliberate-non-uniformity) below for why this surface hand-rolls its retry instead of calling `sendWithNames` [@server-js].
- **Discord** — `callChatRaw`, the single turn-send seam (deliberations use `callProviderChat` instead, and are unaffected), routes through `sendWithNames` directly. The turn's `speaker` is threaded onto the messages (history and the current turn) so the stamp resolves ward vs. villager; Discord's existing inline `[Name]:`/`(WARD)` labels stay as belt-and-suspenders on top [@discord-gateway-js].
- **Voice** — `runVoiceTurn` gained an optional `speaker` parameter, so a diarized non-ward open-mic voice is labelled as that villager on the live turn instead of implying the ward said it; the actual provider round-trip still rides `/api/chat`, so the stamping happens there [@voice-chat-turn-js].
- **Browser tome-writer** (`generateTopicSummary`) — also POSTs to `/api/chat`, so it inherits ward stamping for free; it threads `speaker` onto its shared-room villager turns so those resolve to the villager's slug rather than defaulting to the ward [@app-js].

### The one deliberate non-uniformity

Discord and memorization call `sendWithNames` directly. Voice and the browser tome-writer never call it themselves — both send their turns to `/api/chat`, so they inherit whatever that endpoint does. `/api/chat` is the one surface that hand-rolls the retry inline at its two send points — the non-streaming `fetch` (serving both streaming and non-streaming replies) and the tool-loop's `callUpstream` — rather than calling `sendWithNames` [@server-js] [@app-js] [@voice-chat-turn-js].

This is deliberate, not an oversight: the live chat path has two constraints the throw-based helper cannot meet at once. A genuine 400 has to pass through to the client unchanged, never turned into a 502; and streaming must not be disturbed by a bare retry that then has to resume piping the same response shape. `/api/chat` still reuses the shared `stampNamesOnTurns` and `recordNameFieldResult` primitives, and learns `'no'` only when the bare retry actually succeeds, so an unrelated 400 never permanently disables names for that connection [@server-js]. The primitives it calls are covered by `name-field.js`'s own tests, but the inline retry logic in `server.js` is not covered by the shared-helper test suite. If a third streaming caller ever needs this fallback, that repetition is the signal to extract a streaming-safe variant of `sendWithNames` rather than hand-rolling a third copy.

### Why not split roles differently

The `name` field cannot "split roles" in a way that would let multiple humans appear as distinct role types. Chat has only three roles: `system`, `user`, `assistant`. Multiple humans all become `user` no matter what. [@memorization-js]

The message `speaker` field already carries the same information that the inline `[Name]:` label is generated from (in `discord-gateway` by `attributeUserContent`). Stamping the OpenAI `name` field with a pseudonym handle is what makes the field useful: the model gets a separate identifier namespace that does not depend on the content string. [@memorization-js]
