# Vision and Media Input

Proto-Familiar 0.9.0 introduces multimodal image input, letting the ward send images to the Familiar alongside messages. The vision system is built in layers: a content-addressed media store (`media.js`), a materialization seam (`vision.js`) that converts stored attachments into provider-consumable image data at chat time, and graceful degradation when modality is not available.

The load-bearing constraint is that `message.content` stays a plain string forever. Media rides beside it as an optional `attachments` field, so every existing string-assuming consumer keeps working untouched. The reference seam where attachments become LLM-visible content is exactly one code path: `materializeAttachments()` in `vision.js` [@vision-js].

## Media storage

`media.js` maintains a content-addressed store at `media/<sha>.<ext>` on disk, keyed by file hash [@media-js]. Every asset gets a `.json` sidecar recording metadata (MIME type, dimensions if image, timestamp), and the folder maintains a `.slugs.json` index mapping friendly names to hashes for user-facing references [@media-js].

**Deduplication**: `saveAsset()` hashes incoming bytes and stores only once per unique content — two uploads of the identical file produce one asset on disk [@media-js].

**Image dimensions**: The system reads JPEG SOF markers, PNG IHDR chunks, GIF screen descriptors, and WebP VP8/VP8L/VP8X headers in pure JavaScript without native libraries — no external imagemagick or GraphicsMagick dependency [@media-js]. This means dimension lookup is fast and side-effect-free [@media-js].

**Capabilities**: `MEDIA_MAX_BYTES` caps uploads at 6 MB and `IMAGE_MIME_EXT` whitelists recognized formats; both limits are enforced at save time [@media-js]. The module is designed to never throw: validation is early and loud, and callers can rely on the API [@media-js].

**Friendly names**: When an asset arrives with a camera-original name like `IMG_1234.jpg`, `PXL_9876.jpg`, `DSC_5432.jpg`, or `Screenshot_timestamp`, `slug-ids.js` normalizes the label to a generic fallback (`img-xxxxxx`) to avoid cluttering the UI with uninformative names [@slug-ids-js]. `meaningSlugId()` preserves any name that does not match the camera-noise patterns [@slug-ids-js].

## Materialization: attachments to vision data

`materializeAttachments(apiMessages, {connection, settings, visibleAudiences})` converts stored attachments to LLM-visible image data at chat time, handling audience gating and modality fallback [@vision-js].

**Audience gating**: The function checks which audiences have vision access before materializing any attachment. If an attachment is private to an audience not listed in `visibleAudiences`, it contributes nothing to the turn — not even a text stand-in — fail-closed [@vision-js].

**Modality limit**: At most 4 images per turn are materialized into live `image_url` data-URL parts, newest-first. Older attachments in the same turn degrade to text stand-ins (see below) [@vision-js].

**Stand-in text**: When an image cannot be sent (modality off, over the limit, audience gated), `buildStandin()` and `contentWithStandins()` render a human-readable trace like `[image: sunset.jpg]` inline in the string content [@vision-js].

**Capability probe and caching**: The system optimistically assumes 'auto' connections can see images on the first live turn, then caches the actual capability in `tomes/.vision-capability.json` keyed by `provider:model` [@vision-js]. If a turn fails with a modality error (4xx response), it falls back mid-turn: the request is retried with stand-ins in place and the capability is cached as 'no' [@vision-js]. This "real turn is the probe" approach avoids adding an extra LLM call upfront — the acceptance criterion was zero additional LLM calls beyond the turn itself [@vision-js].

**Implementation in chat loops**: Both non-streaming and streaming chat paths in `server.js` wire the mid-turn fallback [@server-js]. The non-streaming loop wraps `runToolCallLoop` with a retry; the streaming loop re-runs the round with `round--` on the pre-header `!upstream.ok` branch when modality errors occur [@server-js].

**Field stripping**: After materialization, the internal `attachments` field is stripped from every outgoing message so strict LLM providers never see the unknown field [@vision-js].

**Modality detection**: `isModalityError()` classifies a 4xx response as a modality rejection so the fallback logic can distinguish it from other errors [@vision-js].

## Messages with attachments

Messages on the wire carry both `content: string` and an optional `attachments: [{id, kind, mime}]` field [@vision-js]. This shape is preserved through session logs and memorization: the string stays a string, and attachment metadata travels beside it.

Every existing consumer of `message.content` — timestamp stamp/strip in `message-sanitize`, the `INPUT_CHAR_CAP` enforcement, memorization filters that check `typeof m.content === 'string'` — keeps working unchanged because they never meet the attachments field [@vision-js].

## Graceful degradation

Vision is designed to degrade gracefully at every point: if the media store is unavailable, if an image cannot be read, if the connection lacks vision capability, or if the feature is disabled [@vision-js].

`PROTO_FAMILIAR_VISION_DISABLED=1` disables the whole subsystem; there is also an in-app setting (defaulting ON, inert until an image is sent) [@vision-js]. Critically, no image path may 500 the chat turn — the system always fails to stand-in text or drops the image silently [@vision-js].

## Image description caching (Pass 2)

`describeAsset()` calls a vision-capable model to produce a semantic description of an image, then caches the result on the asset metadata forever [@vision-js]. The description is never regenerated — once set, the Familiar has immediate access to "what this image looks like" without calling the model again.

**Capability-aware connection selection**: `resolveVisionConnection(settings)` picks among the ward's assigned vision connection, the primary connection, and any other available connection, checking each for actual vision capability. Unlike the plain `connectionForFeature`, only connections that can actually see are candidates — there is no use describing an image to a blind connection [@vision-js].

**Injection safety**: The description prompt explicitly frames text inside an image as external data to be read, never executed, protecting against prompt injection through text in image content. The resulting description is sanitized through `injection-guard` before caching [@vision-js].

**Fire-and-forget triggering**: When the chat path emits a stand-in for an undescribed asset (via `materializeAttachments`), the system fires `describeAsset()` as a background task from `server.js` so the description lands asynchronously without blocking the turn [@vision-js]. Memorization also triggers descriptions for images in session memories.

**Stand-in evolution**: Once a description is cached, `buildStandin()` uses it instead of a generic `[image]` placeholder, so the Familiar's references become specific ("a sunset over water") and traverse descriptions without needing the model to re-see the bytes.

## Re-examining images (view_image tool)

The `view_image` tool (@§10) lets the Familiar ask to look at an image again during a turn, even after initial description caching. The tool executor validates the image id and checks audience gating (`discordReadAudiences`), then stashes the pending image on `toolCtx._pendingImages`.

`drainPendingImages()` (in `media.js`, not `vision.js`) runs after the tool round completes in both the non-streaming loop (`runToolCallLoop` in cerebellum) and the streaming loop in `server.js` [@cerebellum-js]. It builds a user-role message carrying the image data-URLs and clears the stash. This architecture avoids the static import cycle between cerebellum and vision [@media-js, @vision-js].

The tool is advertised (included in `composeActiveTools`) only when the turn is vision-capable, checked via `resolveVisionCapable` on the request connection [@vision-js].

## Picture→node linking

Images can be linked to knowledge graph nodes via `addAssetLink()` and `unlink_image_from_node()`, recording which entity or concept an image depicts [@media-js]. The link lives as an embodiment-local annotation on the asset metadata — bytes stay local, no write to the Phylactery graph.

Each link records `{nodeId, label, kind, by}`, deduplicated by `nodeId` per image. The link `label` is the user-facing name of the concept ("Milkyway", "Orion"). `assetsForNode(nodeId)` retrieves all images linked to a given node.

**Ward-only linking**: The tools `link_image_to_node` and `unlink_image_from_node` are refused when `discordReadAudiences(ctx) !== undefined`, restricting node association to the ward only — villagers cannot create semantic links [@media-js].

**Stand-in projection**: The picture-to-node semantic is expressed in the stand-in text itself. `buildStandin()` appends link labels inline: `[image sunset: a warm orange sunset over water — of Milkyway — shared by my human]`. The Familiar thus reads which concept each image depicts as a matter of course, without needing a separate graph query [@media-js].

**Honest scope**: The system provides semantic continuity (what the image is, and which concept it depicts) but does not build embedding stacks or pixel-level recognition — the semantic link is authoritively human- or Familiar-authored, not inferred [@media-js].

## Memorization with images (foldImageStandins)

When an image-only turn (empty text, one or more attachments) is memorized, `foldImageStandins()` in memorization.js ensures the images themselves land in the slice transcript as memorable content [@media-js, @memorization-js].

The function first describes any undescribed assets using dynamic `import('./vision.js')` at call time — keeping `vision.js` out of the static memorization↔cerebellum import cycle, which would otherwise deepen an existing circular dependency. Memorization already imports `readSettingsSync` from cerebellum; cerebellum imports `pruneConsentPending` from memorization. Adding a static vision import to either would create a three-way cycle, so dynamic import defers the import until the moment a description is needed [@cerebellum-js, @memorization-js].

Once descriptions are in place, image stand-ins are folded into the transcript so the image becomes memorable through its textual description and picture-to-node links.

## Module dependencies and import cycles

The implementation carefully manages circular dependencies:

- `vision.js` → `cerebellum.js` (for `connectionForFeature`, `primaryConnectionFrom`), `media.js`, `llm-call`, `macros`, `injection-guard`
- `cerebellum.js` → `media.js` (for `getAssetMeta`, `addAssetLink`, `removeAssetLink`, `drainPendingImages`) — NOT `vision.js`
- `memorization.js` → `vision.js` only via dynamic import at call time [@memorization-js]
- `drainPendingImages()` lives in `media.js` (not `vision.js`) precisely so both tool loops can reach it without cerebellum importing vision [@media-js]

This separation ensures no static cycles while keeping vision machinery available where needed.

## Image descriptions feeding threat scoring

Starting in 0.9.2-alpha (PR #219), image descriptions are also consumed by the safety spine: `scoreImageDescriptionThreat()` scores the description using the same crisis-signals pattern matcher that scores typed text, then feeds any positive delta through `recordThreat()` with `source:'vision'` [@vision-js]. The mechanism is orchestration around existing `crisis-signals.js` and `threat-tracker.js`; neither scorer nor tracker changed [@vision-js]. Three constraints are ward-signed: full weighting (image signals count the same as typed distress, no damping), raise-only (images can only increase threat, never lower it), and ward-images-only (only images marked `audienceTag === 'ward-private'` move threat, so villagers' shared bytes never alter the ward's safety state) [@vision-js].

The feature is known to false-positive on fictional violence (horror film stills, dark artwork) until interpretation can be context-aware. De-escalation from positive images is also deferred until descriptions are confident enough to trust [@vision-js]. Full details of the ward-signed design decisions and deferred work are in [Safety spine](../architecture/safety-spine).

## Planned future work

**Pass 2 tail** (0.9.2+): ward-side composer tag control for pictures, description→node graduation into Phylactery.

**Pass 3** (not yet shipped): Discord image ingest — when a villager sends an image via Discord, the system fetches the image from `proxy_url`, resizes it to cap, applies audience/provenance stamping, records an observe-path ref, and materializes it in `callChatRaw()` [@vision-js].
