# Session Memorization

Session memorization is the pipeline that turns a chat session (or a piece of one) into
durable lorebook entries the Familiar can be reminded of later. It is a server-side job
queue owned by `memorization.js`, not a synchronous save: the browser enqueues a job, and a
single in-process worker runs the [extraction](session-memory-extraction) process (framing the transcript for the LLM,
calling the configured LLM, parsing the response), and writes the resulting entries into a
dedicated Tome [@memorization-js] [@sessions-doc]. This subsystem is
one of the two places long-running memory lives in Proto-Familiar — the other is
[Phylactery](phylactery), which owns the Familiar's canonical, autonomously-retrieved memory.
Tomes are explicitly the other kind: human-editable, keyword-triggered lorebook entries (see
[Tomes and keyword lore](tomes-and-lore) for the activation engine and entry format), and
memorization is the automated writer that populates one particular Tome with that shape of
entry [@tomes-doc]. The queue design and its trigger set were a deliberate rewrite to close a
data-loss bug; see [Session memorization: durable queue](../decisions/session-memorization-queue)
for why the shape is what it is.

## The queue and its worker

Jobs persist to `tomes/.memorization-queue.json`, a git-ignored JSON file, so a job survives
tab close, the 3-hour idle rollover, and a server restart [@memorization-js] [@sessions-doc].
A single in-process worker ticks every 5 seconds, picks up jobs whose `nextAttemptAt` has
passed, and drains them one at a time [@memorization-js]. A job's lifecycle is
`pending -> processing -> done | failed`; a failed job with attempts remaining goes back to
`pending` with a new `nextAttemptAt` rather than terminating, following a fixed exponential
backoff of 5s, 30s, 2m, 10m, 30m across a maximum of 5 attempts [@memorization-js]. Any job
still marked `processing` when the server restarts — meaning the previous process died
mid-job — is automatically requeued rather than lost [@memorization-js] [@sessions-doc].
Terminal (`done`/`failed`) jobs stay in the queue until the client acknowledges them via
`POST /api/memorize/:id/ack`, so the UI can toast the outcome exactly once, and are pruned 24
hours after acknowledgment [@memorization-js].

Jobs are deduplicated by a key built from `sessionId + scope + topicId + messageRange` (plus,
for day-scoped jobs, the already-memorized offset) — a matching pending or processing job
short-circuits a re-enqueue instead of creating a duplicate [@memorization-js]. This is what
makes it safe for a terminal event to fire both a server-side enqueue and a client-side
`sendBeacon` enqueue for the same slice of conversation.

## The Session Memories tome

Every memorization job writes into one fixed target: a system Tome named `Session Memories`,
auto-created on first use [@memorization-js] [@tomes-doc]. The find-or-create routine is
shared, behind a process-wide mutex, between the worker and the `GET /api/tomes/session-memories`
endpoint, so a client asking "does this tome exist yet" and the worker's own write path can
never race each other into creating two tomes with the same name [@memorization-js]
[@sessions-doc]. Entries the worker writes are ordinary lorebook entries — editable, disable-able,
deletable through the same Tome UI as any hand-authored entry — carrying `scope`, `topic_id`,
`message_range`, and `session_id` provenance fields that are not part of normal World Info
entries [@sessions-doc]. A per-Tome mutex around the underlying read-modify-write also
serializes concurrent job writes so two jobs finishing close together cannot clobber each
other's entries [@memorization-js] [@sessions-doc].

## Triggers

`public/app.js` enqueues a job from several independent points in the session lifecycle, not
just at session end [@app-js] [@sessions-doc]:

| Trigger | Delivery | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 3-hour idle timeout | `navigator.sendBeacon` | Whole session |
| Manual **Clear** | `navigator.sendBeacon` | Whole session |
| **Memorize now** button | `fetch` | Whole current session, on demand, without ending it |
| `beforeunload` (tab close) | `navigator.sendBeacon` | Current session, if unbeaconed and non-empty |
| **Topic end** | `fetch` | Just that topic's message range |
| Logs modal: Memorize -> Auto-summarize | `fetch` | Any historical session |
| Logs modal: Memorize -> Manual topics | `fetch`, per topic | Each topic range closed in the read-only viewer |

The Auto-summarize/Manual-topics split and the auto-created Session Memories tome both trace to
the exact wording of the Copilot prompt that first specified a "Manage Tomes" button offering
those two choices, from the same founding conversation that named
[Thalamus](../decisions/thalamus-naming) [@naming-conversation].

`sendBeacon` is used specifically for the terminal, page-may-be-gone events (idle timeout,
Clear, `beforeunload`) because the enqueue call itself has to survive the page unloading;
`fetch` is used everywhere the page is known to still be alive [@app-js] [@sessions-doc]. A
30-second poller (plus a poll on window focus) checks `GET /api/memorize`, toasts `done` or
`failed` jobs to the user, and ACKs them so they do not re-toast [@app-js] [@sessions-doc].

## Endpoints

`server.js` exposes the queue over five routes [@server-js]:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/memorize` | Enqueue a job. Accepts `application/json` (fetch) or `text/plain` (sendBeacon's body type). |
| `GET /api/memorize` | List jobs, sanitized — no API keys or message bodies. |
| `POST /api/memorize-day` | Re-feed a calendar date's sessions (day-anchored path, below). |
| `POST /api/memorize/:id/ack` | Mark a terminal job as seen by the UI. |
| `DELETE /api/memorize/:id` | Cancel a pending job; 409 if it is already processing. |
| `GET /api/tomes/session-memories` | Find-or-create the Session Memories tome and return its metadata. |

## What was layered on afterward

`memorization.js` has grown two capabilities beyond the original session/topic queue: a
day-anchored path (`enqueueSessionByDay`, using `day-segments.js` to slice a session by local
calendar date and `memory-coverage.js` to ingest only the un-memorized tail of each day so
re-runs don't duplicate facts) and a source-aware consent gate (`resolveRememberGate`,
which resolves a per-category `true`/`false`/`ask` decision based on WHO a fact is about and
WHETHER the ward told the Familiar directly) [@memorization-js].

The consent gate (`resolveRememberGate`) is source-aware and takes `{direct, hasNamedSubjects}` as inputs [@memorization-js]:

- **Direct channel + fact about the ward** (ward DM or web chat with `audienceTag==='ward-private'`, and the memory is about the ward themselves) → **implied consent: kept without asking** [@claude-md]. The ward told the Familiar on purpose. This only fills the UNSET default; an explicit ward `ask`/`false` in the remember map still wins (explicit settings override implied consent).
- **Third-party subjects** (a registered villager subject, OR a named-but-unregistered person → `hasNamedSubjects`) → **asks for sensitive categories in any channel** [@claude-md]. A stranger's sensitive fact is never swept in without asking.
- **Indirect channels** (group room, shared surface) → **still asks** [@claude-md]. Even ward-private content surfaced indirectly needs explicit consent.

This design killed the confusing flood of date-less consent asks for things the ward said directly. Rationale: memories are what the Familiar *experienced*; being told something directly IS the consent. The `[PENDING MEMORY CONSENT]` block now carries each item's `date` + `reason` (`shared-room`/`third-party`) so asks are explained and time-anchored [@claude-md]. Outcomes are tracked in `.consent-pending.json` for `thalamus.js` to surface. The same file also backs a Discord twin of this queue: the ward's `!queue` command in the [Ward Discord console](ward-console) settles items from a Discord menu through the same `confirmConsentMemories`/`dropPendingMemories` calls, so an item settled from either surface disappears from both [@ward-consent-queue-js].

Both paths (day-anchored segmentation and consent gating) extend the same queue and retry mechanics described above rather than replacing them.

### Coverage status: making 'shared-room' transient, not sticky

`memory-coverage.js`'s per-day ledger backs the coverage view the ward sees for past months
(memorized/uncertain/unmemorized, with uncertain rendering purple). Before 0.11.47,
`memorization.js`'s success path flagged *every* day that touched a non-ward-private slice
(a Discord group room, any shared-audience session) with a permanent `'shared-room'` status
flag, and `deriveStatus` turns any flag on a day into `'uncertain'` regardless of whether that
day's ward-private content was fully memorized [@memory-coverage-js]. The effect was that a
month with any group-room activity stayed purple forever, even after every other day in it
was cleanly memorized — the flag never cleared because nothing in the success path ever
un-set it.

The fix separates two things that had been conflated into one flag: `sharedRoom` is now a
separate, sticky, purely informational marker ("this day had group activity") that never
drives status on its own, while the ledger's `flag` field is reserved for a genuine
`extract-failed` outcome — the kind of flag that is supposed to be replaceable and clearable
by a later successful run [@memory-coverage-js]. `recordSegmentRun` and `computeCoverage` both
migrate any legacy sticky `'shared-room'` flag they encounter into the new `sharedRoom`
marker on read, so existing months un-purple automatically the next time the coverage view is
computed, with no re-run of memorization needed [@memory-coverage-js].

The extraction prompts built here also supply a `content_tag` per extracted fact — a topic plus
a sensitivity level that later controls per-villager disclosure independently of `category`. See
[Content-based memory gating](content-gating) for the tag vocabulary, the code-side validation
that never trusts the model's tag directly, and how the tag composes with `resolveRememberGate`
and the audience floor at recall time.

## Reliability and capacity hardening (0.12.5–0.12.6)

A 2026-09-16 audit found the queue completing only about 0.7% of memorization jobs (993 of
1016 failed), heaviest against the z.ai provider, with the 10-minute coverage sweep
re-enqueuing the same failing slices roughly 40 times an hour. Five bugs in the shared
extraction path plus three systemic gaps in the queue itself had turned isolated failures
into a self-sustaining loop; the fix landed as three passes across 0.12.5-alpha and
0.12.6-alpha [@memorization-js].

**Enqueue-time gates.** Two checks now run before a job is created, on top of the
pending/processing dedup described above. A failed `dupKey` is held for
`FAILED_REENQUEUE_COOLDOWN_MS` (6 hours) after its `finishedAt` before a fresh attempt is
allowed, so the periodic coverage sweep cannot burn a provider call on the same failing slice
every ten minutes — a transient failure still gets retried, just not on every tick
[@memorization-js]. And `genuineTurns()` — `filterReadable` minus any turn whose entire
content is a single bracketed marker such as `[OpenClaw heartbeat poll]` — lets
`enqueueMemorization` skip a slice with no genuinely conversational turn before it ever reaches
the provider, following the repo's "gate cheap cases in code before the LLM" rule (see
[Engineering conventions](../reference/engineering-conventions)) [@memorization-js].

**Worker timeout.** `callProvider` had no timeout, so one hung `fetch` could freeze the single
in-process worker slot indefinitely — the incident's actual mid-run gap was one job claimed
that never returned, with nothing else processed afterward. Every call is now bounded by
`AbortSignal.timeout(EXTRACTION_TIMEOUT_MS)` (120s); a timeout surfaces as an ordinary job
failure, which the existing backoff schedule and job-rotation already know how to handle, so
the worker cycles to the next job and returns to the timed-out one later [@memorization-js].
The boot-time recovery that requeues jobs still `processing` after a restart, and the
backoff/rotation logic itself, already existed — the missing piece was specifically the
per-call bound, since a single-slot worker with no timeout can wedge on one hung call no
matter how good its restart and rotation logic is.

**Crash-after-write duplication.** A `ReferenceError` in the consent-pending item's `standing`
field — it referenced an out-of-scope variable — threw *after* `createMemoryFull` had already
written the memory, so the job failed and its retry re-extracted and re-created the same fact;
only near-duplicate merging kept this from compounding further. The fix assigns the boolean the
consent queue actually reads (`ward-consent-queue.js` renders "…, a standing fact" from it):
`standing: fact?.temporality === 'standing'` [@memorization-js] [@ward-consent-queue-js]. A
different fix that the original bug report suggested — assigning `wardStanding` itself — would
have been wrong: `wardStanding` is the whole per-category standing-consent map, not a per-item
boolean, so assigning it would have made every consent ask read "a standing fact." The correct
fix only became visible by checking what the *consumer* in `ward-consent-queue.js` actually
reads, not by trusting the suggested patch [@memorization-js] [@ward-consent-queue-js].

The remaining two fixes from this hardening pass change extraction-side behavior rather than
queue mechanics — treating a genuinely empty extraction as success instead of failure, and
bounding provider input size by chunking an oversized transcript — and are described in
[Session Memory Extraction](session-memory-extraction).

## The memory-integrity gate (0.12.27-alpha)

`processJob` now runs one more check per extracted fact, immediately before the
`createMemoryFull` call: a new gate, separate from the consent gate above, that asks whether
the fact itself looks corrupted or adversarial rather than whether the ward has consented to
keep it. A suspect fact from a shared room is held in a reversible quarantine instead of being
written; a suspect fact in the ward's own direct words is written but flagged for review. See
[Memory integrity: the memorization-to-Phylactery gate](memory-integrity) for the detection
patterns, the provenance policy, the quarantine store, and the ward-facing review surface
[@memorization-js].
