# Noticing

Noticing is an [autonomous loop](autonomous-loops) that allows the Familiar to observe and act on patterns in the ward's life without being prompted — due intentions, overdue past events awaiting resolution, contact gaps, and aging commitments. It is the organ closing the gap the Initiative Pass 4 existed to fill: a way for the Familiar to think and act as an agent on its own observations, rather than only when summoned by the ward [@noticing-js].

Unlike [silence-triage](safety-spine) or warm reach-out, noticing deliberately **does not stand down at elevated threat**. The ward's design decision frames this as "especially useful" when things are hard: a due grounding round or a slipping need most deserves to be noticed exactly when the Familiar is already in closer engagement [@noticing-js] [@claude-md]. Because noticing reads and acts on the ward's safety-adjacent surface, any behavioral change to when or whether it acts requires ward sign-off (named in CLAUDE.md alongside the crisis-spine files) [@noticing-js] [@claude-md].

## Role fix: entity-as-subject in the noticing reflection (0.11.86)

The noticing reflection — the Familiar's own turn of introspection — now assembles as a SYSTEM message framed alongside identity, via the pure helper `noticingMessages({identity, body, cue})` [@noticing-js]. The `user` slot holds only a bare `(a quiet moment)` cue, kept solely because several providers (GLM/z.ai, DeepSeek family) refuse to complete when there is no user turn at all [@noticing-js]. The Familiar's words are never in the `user` role, preserving [entity-as-subject](../concepts/entity-as-subject): the entity owns its reflections and decisions, rather than appearing to be operated by the ward [@noticing-js].

This was a regression in the original implementation: the noticing deliberation went out on a `user` role turn, framing the entity as being run rather than thinking. The fix is one instance of a general pattern that appeared across other autonomous loops (triage, warm reach-out, pondering). By 0.11.93-alpha, this pattern was systematized with a shared helper function across all inner-voice deliberations. See [Deliberations Delivered as System Messages](../decisions/deliberations-as-system-messages) for the scope of the pattern and the architectural reasoning [@noticing-js].

## The consequence loop: why it re-asked, and the close (0.11.86)

### The problem: overdue events with no way to record answers

The overdue-event wake fires on one fact: an event node has no `resolution` [@noticing-outcomes-js]. The noticing toolset had no tool to write a resolution, so the turn could ask "how did it go?" but never record the answer — and on the next tick, with the event still unresolved, asked again [@noticing-outcomes-js]. A tester reported the Familiar asking three times about the same past event even after being answered.

### The fix: resolution tools + outcome tracking

`schedule_resolve` and `schedule_calibrate_link` are now in `NOTICING_REGISTRY_TOOL_NAMES` and count as proactive acts (classified by `NOTICING_PROACTIVE_TOOLS`) [@noticing-js]. This lets the Familiar close the loop by recording how an event actually turned out.

The noticing prompt renders overdue events as a NOTEPAD, each with its slug id and the closing tools named inline (operability: the Familiar cannot close what it cannot name) [@noticing-js]. The prompt directs: check the conversation first, close when already answered (prompted or unprompted), only ask otherwise [@noticing-outcomes-js].

The ending swaps by state: when open outcomes exist, the prompt directs "update the graph"; when nothing is open, the capabilities list returns (the list distracts while an outcome is open) [@noticing-js].

### Context window: look-back to the oldest open event

`getRecentSessionMessages()` reads back over the ward's own private turns to check whether an
outcome was already mentioned. Its slice is stamped with provenance metadata — which log it
came from, who was in the room, whether any turn is the ward's own — and the noticing prompt
renders a code-computed line naming the room when the slice is not an ordinary ward-private
one; see [Slice provenance is captured at the read, never reconstructed on
recall](../decisions/slice-provenance-captured-at-read) for the incident this closes and why
selection itself stays unchanged [@server-js].

`getRecentSessionMessages()` gained a `since` bound [@noticing-js]. When an outcome is open, the noticing turn reads back to the **oldest open event** (capped at `max`=60 messages) instead of the fixed 6-turn tail [@noticing-js]. This solves the "chicken flood" case: a day of unrelated chatter that would bury the exchange where the ward already said how it went [@noticing-outcomes-js]. The prompt now directs the model to check the conversation first, so it can close on sight without repeating the ask [@noticing-outcomes-js].

## Enforcement: the no-nag ledger (0.11.86)

A close counts **only when a real `schedule_resolve` is written** for the event id — never on the model's say-so [@noticing-outcomes-js]. This is the [lesson-#5 discipline](../decisions/proactivity-over-caution): a real side-effect cannot be closed on the model's word alone.

The ledger `.noticing-asked.json` (tomes dir) maps `eventId` to `askedAtMs` [@noticing-outcomes-js]. An event already asked about (a reach-out actually went out AND it is still unresolved) is **suppressed from surfacing for `ASK_COOLDOWN_MS`** (20 hours) [@noticing-outcomes-js]. This tradeoff was ward-signed:

- **Suppress-until-cooldown** (the chosen path): guarantees no repeated asking; the cost is a close can lag up to the cooldown.
- **Annotate-and-keep-surfacing**: keeps the event visible but risks repeated nags if the answer stays unresolved.

An answer that stays in the look-back window closes on the next surface, even after the cooldown passes [@noticing-outcomes-js]. The unprompted-answer path is unaffected: an event never asked about surfaces normally and closes on sight without ever stamping an ask [@noticing-outcomes-js]. Per-event closed/asked/left logging makes a never-closing loop visible [@noticing-outcomes-js].

## Outcome classification and wait-streak integration

`classifyNoticingOutcome()` evaluates whether a turn took a proactive action [@noticing-js]. Tools like `schedule_resolve` and `reach_out_to_ward` count as acts and reset the wait-streak; tools like `intention_list` or `schedule_find` are reads and do not [@noticing-js].

Noticing integrates with the shared `wait-streak.js` module (also used by warm reach-out, silence-triage, and the Discord gateway's ambient presence block) to track deliberated choices across loops [@noticing-js]. The wait-streak tags its entries `source:'noticing'`: a proactive act resets the streak, a stand-down increments it [@noticing-js].

## Wake conditions: when noticing takes a turn

Noticing only deliberates when a **code-evaluated wake condition** fires [@noticing-js]:

- A due intention (its scheduled time has passed)
- A contact gap past the baseline p90
- A readiness gap
- An aging untriggered intention or tell (older than `AGING_INTENT_MS` ≈ 5 days)
- An aging unresolved floating task (older than `AGING_TASK_MS` ≈ 7 days)
- An overdue event (past its time for ≥ 6 hours, still unresolved)
- A memory saved with fuzzy attribution, now aged enough to re-resolve (`unresolved_attribution`, below)

No wake condition → no turn, ever [@noticing-js]. The situation report is code-built and capped to prevent habituation [@noticing-js]. Condition vocabulary on due intentions is code-evaluated (tripwires like "contact gap past p90" or "a specific need is missed"), not left to the model [@noticing-js].

## Re-resolving fuzzy attribution

[Session Memory Extraction](session-memory-extraction) sometimes files a fact with the actor
unresolved rather than guessing or dropping it, marking the row with a low
`attribution_confidence` that [Phylactery](phylactery) downweights in recall but never removes.
That downweight is a holding pattern, not a fix — the noticing loop is where the correction
actually happens. `gatherNoticingWakeInputs` (server.js) calls
`listUnresolvedAttributions({threshold: 0.5, minAgeDays: 1, limit: 3})`, Phylactery's read path
for memories whose attribution is still fuzzy and old enough (≥1 day) that the moment has
settled [@server-js] [@memory-module]. Each result becomes an `unresolved_attribution` wake
condition, rendered in the situation report with the memory's snippet, id, and any tentatively-
pinned subjects, directing the Familiar to fix the subjects and firm up the attribution with
`update_memory_by_id` if it can now tell, or leave the entry alone if it still can't [@noticing-js].

The sweep is gated separately from the rest of noticing: `s?.noticingAttributionResweepEnabled`
(default on) and `PROTO_FAMILIAR_ATTRIBUTION_RESWEEP_DISABLED=1` turn it off, degrading to an
empty condition list on failure or when disabled rather than blocking the rest of the wake check
[@server-js]. It rides noticing's existing wake/tick cadence instead of running its own schedule —
code decides when a shaky memory has settled enough to be worth revisiting, and only then does a
turn happen, so the sweep adds no standing LLM cost of its own [@server-js].

The wake condition shipped together with the tools it needs to act: `recall`, `read_memory_by_id`,
and `update_memory_by_id` were added to `NOTICING_REGISTRY_TOOL_NAMES`, and `update_memory_by_id`
was taught to accept `subjects` and `attribution_confidence` so the correction can actually be
written, not just noticed [@cerebellum-js]. See
[Attribution confidence: degrade the attribution, not the fact](../decisions/attribution-confidence-degrades-not-drops)
for the full three-layer decision this wake condition is the closing layer of.

## Cadence and self-pacing

Noticing runs on self-paced cadence via `set_next_check`, clamped to 5 minutes (floor) through 6 hours (ceiling) [@noticing-loop-js]. The default adaptive window is 2 hours after a proactive act (the turn did its thing), or 45 minutes after a stand-down (something was flagged and left) [@noticing-js].
