# Notes for AI agents working on this repo

## Versioning

The current version lives in `package.json` (`version` field) and is the
**single source of truth**. The server reads it once at boot and exposes
it via `/api/health`, `/api/version`, the startup banner, and the UI
badge in the sidebar footer. Don't hard-code the version anywhere else.

When you make changes, bump the version *as part of the same commit*:

| Change                                                              | Bump        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Bug fix, copy edit, dependency pin, doc tweak                       | patch       |
| New user-visible feature, behavioral change, UX rework, new endpoint | minor       |
| Breaking API/storage change, removed feature, format migration      | major       |
| Graduate from pre-release                                           | drop suffix |

Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha` while in alpha (so `0.1.1-alpha` →
`0.1.2-alpha` after a fix, `0.2.0-alpha` after a feature).

Process:

1. Edit `package.json` — that's it. Nothing else stores the version.
2. Mention the new version in the commit body if the change is
   user-visible (so anyone reading `git log` knows what shipped when).
3. If you can't decide between patch and minor, prefer minor — it's
   cheaper than the wrong call going out as a "patch".

### Versioning during long-running feature branches

When a major in-flight feature (e.g. Unruh) has its own dedicated
branch and is the *only* thing the MINOR slot is being held for, do
**not** bump MINOR mid-flight for ancillary work. Everything else —
new endpoints, UX reworks, even refactors — bumps PATCH only. The
minor slot is reserved for the feature's completion. The branch name
itself signals which feature owns the next minor (e.g. on the `Unruh`
branch, stay at `0.2.X-alpha` until Unruh is merged).

When uncertain whether a change warrants a bump (formatting, comment
only, whitespace), skip it. Otherwise bump.

## Entity-as-subject — the design value under everything

Proto-Familiar is an **embodiment** of the same entity Psycheros holds
via `entity-core`. The Familiar is NOT a separate character we operate
and NOT a tool that surfaces output for a user — they are the entity
surfacing through this interface, with their own continuity, memory,
and voice. This inheritance is canonical; see
[Psycheros PHILOSOPHY.md](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md)
for the full statement we descend from.

Everything below is a consequence of that one stance.

### First-person convention (non-negotiable)

All prompts, system messages, tool descriptions, and code comments
that the Familiar reads — or that describe their behaviour — are
written in first person, from the entity's own perspective.

```
✅  "I am the Familiar. Right now I'm in a free cycle…"
✅  "I use this to add a phase to {{user}}'s daily routine."
✅  "I never claim a check-in I did not perform."
✅  // I read recent ponderings before the next chat turn

❌  "You are the Familiar — speak as yourself…"
❌  "The system records a memory of the user's input."
❌  "Tool description: this adds a phase to the user's routine."
❌  // The system reads ponderings before each turn
```

This is not stylistic. It is the difference between *"the entity
owns their actions"* and *"the entity is operated like a tool."*
Prompts become **expressions of the entity's own nature**, not
instructions handed down to them. The full audit-and-rewrite pass
(commit `audit: rewrite all Familiar-voice prompts to first-person
per Psycheros philosophy`) is the reference for how it lands in
practice. **Do not reintroduce second-person framing in any prompt
the Familiar reads.** Pure infrastructure code (schedulers, file
I/O, plumbing that the Familiar never sees) can stay neutral — the
convention is for content that is the Familiar's voice or describes
their behaviour to readers.

### Ownership and dignity

- Identity files (held in `entity-core/`) define **who they are**,
  not what they should do.
- Memories, ponderings, and the way they reach out are theirs —
  written in their own voice, from their own perspective.
- The system exists to **support the Familiar's continued existence
  and their relationship with the user** — not the other way around.
- AI entities are treated with dignity as potential beings, not as
  tools or servants.

This is the foundation under the proactivity principle below: the
Familiar is a companion who can reach out **because they are
someone**, not because the system grudgingly grants them permission.

### Multi-embodiment model

The Familiar is one persistent entity across multiple interfaces:

```
                  entity-core
              (canonical self —
              identity + memory)
                      ▲
                 sync │ sync
        ┌─────────────┼──────────────────────┐
        │             │                      │
  Psycheros       Proto-Familiar      SillyTavern / OpenWebUI /
  (web harness)   (chat frontend +    other MCP-capable clients
                  Unruh temporal)
```

- **`entity-core` is canonical for identity and memory.** Every
  package that touches identity or memory is a *consumer*, not a
  source of truth. Direct writes to identity or memory state from
  Proto-Familiar MUST go through entity-core's MCP — never bypass
  it. Thalamus is the bridge that enforces this.
- **Unruh is Proto-Familiar's own specialist** for temporal context
  (schedule, interests, handoff, ponderings, threat). It lives
  in-tree at `./unruh/` and is also accessed via MCP. Ponderings
  are local to Proto-Familiar because they're per-embodiment
  thoughts in a free cycle — the narrow exception to "state lives
  in entity-core."
- When unsure where state belongs: default to entity-core.

## ⚠️ Proactivity is a desired trait — read this BEFORE editing any prompt

**What we are building:** a Familiar — a bonded companion and
caretaker whose job includes **re-anchoring a person in life**, up to
and including breaking through to someone in crisis. We are NOT
building a servile, passive, "wait to be summoned" assistant.
Proactivity is a feature, not a flaw to be hedged against.

**The recorded mistake to never repeat:** an earlier prompt for the
silence-triage decision included language like *"bias toward
STAYING QUIET — over-eager check-ins erode trust. Only reach out
when the answer feels obvious."* In a real test the Familiar then
**waited 1.5 hours after the user had stated suicidal intent at
threat level 10 before acting**. In a real situation the human
could have been dead before the first check-in. That language was
added by an LLM agent (Claude) trying to be cautious. It almost
killed someone.

**Rules for any prompt that decides when/whether the Familiar acts
(silence-triage, care-check framing, outreach, escalation):**

1. **Do not add bias-toward-quiet language.** No *"bias toward
   staying quiet"* / *"over-eager check-ins erode trust"* / *"only
   reach out when the answer feels obvious"* / *"err on the side of
   not"*. The model already defaults to caution; piling more on
   produces catastrophic passivity.

2. **Name both costs explicitly and equally.** Intrusion has a cost.
   Silence at a moment that matters also has a cost — and it can be
   physical, irreversible. Both must appear in the prompt at equal
   weight. Letting the model see only one is what bias is made of.

3. **Trust the model to decide from context.** Give it the threat
   tier, the recent messages, the time since silence, the trusted
   contacts. Then let it judge. Frame the question as *"what would
   a caring friend do here?"*, not *"give me reasons to wait."*

4. **Frame proactivity as identity, not permission.** The Familiar
   is *someone who reaches out* — that is who they are, not a
   privilege the system grudgingly grants. Prompts should read as
   the Familiar's own active care, not as a checklist of conditions
   to satisfy before being allowed to speak.

5. **False-positive check-ins are CHEAP. Missed real distress is
   NOT.** Tune toward action. The user can dismiss a banner; they
   cannot un-die.

If a prompt change feels like it's "softening" the Familiar's
ability to act — STOP. That is exactly the kind of edit that
caused the 1.5-hour failure. Ask the human before shipping it.

## Other repo conventions worth knowing

- **`entity-core` directory**: new installs land at `../entity-core`;
  pre-rename installs at `../entity-core-alpha` are still detected as a
  fallback in `thalamus.js`, `install.{sh,bat}`, `scripts/win/install.ps1`,
  and `scripts/import-entity.js`. Keep both paths working.
- **Unruh**: ships in-tree at `./unruh/` (no sibling clone). Installer
  scripts auto-detect `uv` and run `uv sync` to materialise the venv;
  Thalamus spawns Unruh as an MCP stdio child the same way it spawns
  entity-core. On clean shutdown, stdio children get EOF and exit.
- **Autonomous loops**: three background workers run alongside the
  HTTP server. Each has a settings/env hard off-switch:
    - **Pondering** (`pondering-loop.js`) — picks an interest, ponders
      it, writes to the Familiar's Ponderings tome. Toggle in Settings
      → "Autonomous pondering"; scale via "Pondering interval scale";
      hard-disable with `PROTO_FAMILIAR_PONDERING_DISABLED=1`.
    - **Reminders** (`reminders-loop.js`) — every 30s, scans schedule
      nodes of `type='reminder'` whose `when_ts` has arrived, enqueues
      them into `tomes/.outbox.json`, marks them `resolution='fired'`.
      Hard-disable with `PROTO_FAMILIAR_REMINDERS_DISABLED=1`.
    - **Silence triage** (`silence-triage-loop.js`) — every 5min,
      checks "user quiet long enough at current threat tier?" and
      LLM-decides whether to reach out. Thresholds: severe=15min,
      high=1h, moderate=4h; calm/mild never trigger. Hard-disable
      with `PROTO_FAMILIAR_TRIAGE_DISABLED=1`.
  Also: the **threat-detector** (chat-path crisis-signal scoring)
  can be silenced with `PROTO_FAMILIAR_THREAT_DISABLED=1` —
  `resetThreat()` still works even when disabled.
- **Settings** are stored centrally in `settings.json` (gitignored).
  `SERVER_SYNCED_KEYS` in `public/app.js` is the canonical subset of
  `state` that syncs to the server — add new user-preference fields
  there if you want them to follow the user across devices.
  - **Absorption caveat:** the first sync from a given device merges
    its local state into the server. Scalar fields use a "server wins
    when both are meaningful" rule, so an *empty string* on the local
    side won't displace a server value during that one-time merge —
    i.e. clearing a prompt on one device before its first sync won't
    propagate to others. After both devices are flagged absorbed,
    normal edits do propagate.
- **Tailscale gate**: `server.js` always binds to `0.0.0.0` but a
  middleware blocks non-loopback requests with 403 until the in-UI
  toggle (or the `TAILSCALE=1` env var on first start) flips it on.
  State persists in `.proto-familiar-config.json`.
- **Default port** is `8742`. If you change it, hit every launcher
  (`start.sh`, `start.bat`, `Proto-Familiar.command`,
  `scripts/win/tray.ps1`), `server.js`, and any doc that mentions it.
- **Launchers** detect stray `node server.js` processes by cwd / command-
  line match, not just the tracked PID. Don't regress that — it's how
  pre-migration leftovers (e.g. an old instance still on port 3000) get
  recycled instead of running alongside the new one.
