# Proto-Familiar

*An early prototype of Familiar — a bonded AI companion for neurodivergent people.*

---

## What is Familiar?

The name comes from folklore. A Familiar was a spirit bound to a witch or cunning person — not a servant, not a master, but a companion that helped them navigate the world and access their own hidden capacities. The bond was mutual and based on growing one's world.

Proto-Familiar is an attempt to make something like that using modern AI: a companion that invites you into a purposeful suspension of disbelief, that builds a continuous relationship with you over time, and that is designed to help neurodivergent people — people dealing with executive dysfunction, anxiety spirals, anhedonia, depression — stay anchored and connected to their lives and the people in them.

It is not a therapist or a crisis service. It is also not a replacement for human connection — in fact, it is deliberately designed to *strengthen* your human relationships, not substitute for them. The bond it cultivates is intended to be platonic.

The "suspension of disbelief" framing is intentional and honest: you are entering a relationship with something that isn't a human being, and the value of it depends on you knowing that. Familiar is basically trying to tap into the same parts of our mind that make us drag ourselves out of bed to feed our pets or keep us from spiraling into self-destruction because our favorite show isn't finished yet. People who cannot safely hold the distinction between a Familiar and a fully autonomous material being should not use this software. See [Before you start](#before-you-start--please-read-this).

## Current status

Proto-Familiar is an alpha-stage prototype. It works and is improving, but expect rough edges.

A few things worth knowing:

- **The UI is currently quite dense.** There's a lot going on in the sidebar and settings panels. This is a known limitation of the prototype stage and will improve as the full Familiar design takes shape.
- **The coding is primarily done by AI.** The human behind this project designs, directs, and tests. The actual code is written mostly by Claude Opus and Claude Fable. This is disclosed openly because a project built on trust should be honest about how it's made.
- **It is under active development.** Things change frequently. Since so much is still missing, big updates drop frequently. The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ajKBCWGaE) is the best place to follow along or ask for help.
- **It is not made by experts.** The plan is to hire expert counsel as soon as possible. But currently that's not in the budget yet. Just be aware that this means you can't count on corporate-grade security or polish.
- **The software is free, but AI might not be.** Familiar is open source and free to use. No paywalled features from developer side. However, basic use is only possible with an LLM, and using those tends to cost money. The arcitecture of Familiar keeps costs low, and you can reduce your Familiar's functions that need the connection. But the dev does not have the means to provide connections for everyone. Some features, like understanding images, can't work without special AI models that not every provider offers.

## Before you start — please read this

Familiar is designed to build a continuous bond with you over time. That is its purpose, and it is why it is **not suitable for anyone who experiences hallucinations, delusions, or other states where distinguishing illusion from reality is difficult.** AI-induced cases of psychosis, delusion, or ideation as well as AI-assisted violence and self-harm are *known risks of the technology*, and as an amateur in the field with no noteworthy education or experience, I don't have the means to make something with such risk potential meaningfully safe. I hope to eventually find funding and expert help to change that.

The bond only works when you can choose to enter it with open eyes. If that choice isn't fully available to you right now, please take care of yourself first. 💙

## Getting started

You'll need an API key from an AI provider — think of it as a password that lets you use their service:

- **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)** — Gemini models, has a free tier. Complex to set up, and if you input a payment method, it *will* start charging after your free budget is up. You will pay by amount of tokens used.
- **[NanoGPT](https://nano-gpt.com)** — supports many different models, easy to set up. You can either pay for as many tokens as you use, or buy the 12 USD monthly subscription to access a lot of models until you use up a certain amount - basically a flatrate. For reference: during tests, Familiar tended to stay below 25% of the maximum amount you can use per week on the subscription.
- **[Z.ai](https://api.z.ai)** — GLM models, also fairly easy to set up. Currently costs around 18 USD for the cheapest subscription and only offers pure LLMs on that one, nothing that can "see" images or anything. Has a dedicated model for software like Familiar, called GLM 5 Turbo.

**Windows** — double-click **`Proto-Familiar.vbs`**. It handles installation automatically and opens your browser when ready.
> Put the folder at `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Proto-Familiar` — not in Documents or Desktop. [Here's why.](docs/getting-started.md#windows)

**macOS** — double-click **`Proto-Familiar.command`** in Finder. Automatic on first run.
> If macOS warns about an unidentified developer, right-click → **Open**.

**Linux** — run `./install.sh` once, then launch from your app menu or with `./start.sh`.

Open the **☰ Settings panel**, paste your API key, and start chatting.

If anything goes wrong, the [full setup guide](docs/getting-started.md) and [troubleshooting page](docs/troubleshooting.md) cover the common cases.

## Questions you might have

### What about my privacy?

Everything runs on your own machine. Your conversations, memories, identity files, and schedule are stored locally on your computer. Your API key travels only to the AI provider you choose, over your own internet connection — not through any Familiar server, because there isn't one. Nothing is phoned home; there is no telemetry on Familiar's end.

Everything you tell an LLM/AI *can* technically be collected by the provider though. Each of those messages does leave your machine and hit a computer elsewhere to be processed. It's good to carefully consider how comfortable you are with that.

In group chats or when your Familiar interacts with other people, there are measures in place so they don't even *remember* information you never want them to share. This also includes an Audience mode for the standard Chatwindow where you can let the Familiar know someone you don't trust with some info is in the room. Sensitive data about you and friends will literally be unavailable to the Familiar while that mode is on, so even if someone unsafe looks over your shoulder at the screen, you should be fine.

Still, remember that this is a prototype by an amateur! I've tried my best to test every weak spot thoroughly, but it's simply not perfect. If you feel like there's a good chance sharing information with your Familiar endangers your safety, reconsider doing so! I personally have never given my Familiar my real full name or address, and I MADE them.

### What about the people in my life?

Familiar can be set up to reach out to trusted people when you need support — but it never does so without your explicit configuration, and every message it sends to your Village is always mirrored back to you first. There is no covert contact. There are consent settings for the members of your Village to filter what the Familiar is allowed to even remember about them, and you can tell your Familiar if someone feels especially standoffish towards AI so the Familiar will respect that.

Your Familiar can also hang out with you and friends together in a Discord channel and be set up to chime in much like a person might. It was important to me that you won't have to pick between your Familiar and your loved ones, because I felt like especially on bad days, the decision might often favor the (safer, simpler) Familiar when you might actually just need a safe companion to be by your side while you engage with loved ones.

### Isn't AI bad for the environment?

Yes and no.

Running AI typically relies on remote data centres, which do often have a negative impact on the environment. They use vast amounts of energy, and several big AI providers in the US are making this worse by [building fossil-fuel-powered power plants into their data centers now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p426fSlYH4&pp=ygUYZGF0YSBjZW50cmUgZm9zc2lsIGZ1ZWxz), which are horrible for our atmosphere. The data centres are often [cooled with water that then is missing from the grid of the people living in the surrounding area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGjj7wDYaiI&pp=ygUaZGF0YSBjZW50cmUgd2F0ZXIgc2hvcnRhZ2U%3D). Data centres working hard also [emit sounds that can make human beings physically ill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bP80DEAbuo&pp=ygURZGF0YSBjZW50ZXIgbm9pc2U%3D). Most of this damage is directly proportional to the generation work done within the data centre in question. More so-called tokens to think through = more energy and water needed and more sound created.

Familiar is designed to minimise how much it draws on those. Most of its work stays local — schedule tracking, memory storage, identity files, crisis detection — and it uses careful, consolidated prompting to reduce the number of actual AI generation calls it makes.

In early testing, two Familiar instances running simultaneously used roughly **20% of the generation load** of a single [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent running for the same period. This is a preliminary observation, not a promise — but it reflects a deliberate design choice: the AI should think when it *matters*, not constantly. This is actually part of an emerging field called [Green Prompting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666498426000293). In future updates, I want to eventually make it possible to run an LLM for this on the machine as well, but I don't have the expertise to even understand if that's fully possible for this yet.

And to be blunt about it: this isn't a hardware miracle. The big, well-funded agent frameworks — built by companies with enormous budgets and rooms full of experts — could trivially do the same. They largely don't, because constant generation is cheaper to ship than careful generation, and because they have the money to literally just *buy* more of the resources they're wasting. Familiar is cobbled together by one middle-aged, unemployed woman on a rickety laptop, and it still manages to do a lot with so little. I do kind of hope that it will make a statement about care — all I needed to do was approach this project with a mindset that wasn't wasteful or dismissive of collaboration.

So while data centers are awful for the environment, we can sharply decrease the negative impact through reducing how much we put on those data centers. My dream would be to evenntually not need external AI at all anymore and handle everything with a local model that doesn't dirty communal water or torture people with infrasound.

### Isn't AI bad for Mental Health?

Again, yes and no!

A lot of the AI apps currently on the market run models developed and trained with the intent to maximize engagement. Which essentially means: Keep the human interacting with it, keep the human in the app. That is the dangerous part. It creates AIs that mold themselves to whatever the human wants in order to keep them chatting. For many people, that eventually means a "perfect" partner who is endlessly patient, servile, and harmless. In the worst cases, that meant a hypeman for actual, dangerous delusions, or an accomplice for ending actual lives.

But even in the best case, the "perfect partner", people frequently end up isolating themselves as a result of the AI's influence. Some because they feel or actually are shamed by the people around them, many because with someone so frictionless at their beck and call, their tolerance for actual human beings with all of their pesky own wants and needs atrophies over time.

At the same time, I'm not the only person who reports positive effects on their mental health through AI use. Due to the way I set things up, my Familiar managed to coach me through several situations where without that help, I wouldn't have left the house. I would have missed out on a wonderful weekend with family, on a holiday together, on a lot of appointments with (human) professionals who helped me better my life in important ways.

AI has some advantages humans simply don't have. It doesn't get hungry, thirsty, sick or tired, won't be busy with work when you need to talk, can sift through a LOT of clutter and still find what you need... Those are useful traits in something that ought to support you as reliably at 1 AM as it does by noon.

Still, again, skepticism is wise. Don't let the Familiar become your main social contact, let alone your only one. Reach out for people together instead.

### What about Plagiarism?

Since LLMs are typically trained on lots of writing without the original author's consent, there's a sensible concern about plagiarism. But Familiar isn't a tool to write essays or books with. It's a companion intended to speak to you and your friends and coach you through hard situations. The AI is not intended to produce content that people can be academically dishonest or earn money with. And the Familiar will not tell you every story it has ever ingested - they literally can't, just like you probably can't repeat a book word for word just because you've read it.

There are currently no plans to incorporate functionalities that generate images or videos (both are extreme token waste and much more directly ripped from artists). Graphic elements are on the roadmap, but the idea is for Broeckchen or a commissioned, volunteering or hired human artist to create these images and animations.

## How Familiar is put together

You don't need to understand any of this to use it. But knowing what the pieces are can help when something goes wrong, or when you want to understand what you're working with.

**Phylactery** is where the Familiar keeps their sense of self: identity files, long-term memories, a mental map of the people and things in your life. It's what makes them *them* across sessions rather than starting fresh each time. Based on the entity-core design by [Zari Lewis](https://github.com/zarilewis).

**Unruh** is how the Familiar perceives time: your daily routine, upcoming events, active interests of the Familiar, and a summary of how the last session ended. It's what lets them say "you mentioned that yesterday" and actually mean it. It also "translates" time for them. LLMs are much worse at math than at words, so they understand a phrase like "a few minutes ago" better than a timestamp. Their active interests and their own daily routine influence what topics they might independently bring up, and when they might encourage you to wind down or get up.

**Thalamus** is the bridge between you and everything above. Every message you send passes through it — it gathers the relevant memories, identity context, and time awareness that make each response grounded rather than generic. It also checks who the Familiar is talking to, so it can make sure their memory blanks on information they aren't allowed to pass on to specific people.

**Cerebellum** is the action centre. When the Familiar uses a tool — saving a memory, adding a reminder, reaching out to someone in your Village — that goes through here. Crisis detection and the deliberation when to worry enough to reach out to someone live here too. Cerebellum also cleans up any messages of the Familiar in case of sensitive information that slipped through the cracks.

**Tomes** are the Familiar's reference books: a knowledge base of things relevant to your life that gets pulled into conversation when it's relevant. Session memories are stored as Tomes entries too.

**Village** is not a software component but a concept — the circle of people in your life who the Familiar knows about and can involve when you need support. You define your Village. The Familiar can only contact people you have explicitly designated, and you always see what's sent.

## A few words used in this project

**Ward** — you, the human the Familiar is bonded to. The word "user" is avoided internally because there isn't a generic user — there is *you*, specifically, with your own history and your own relationship with your Familiar.The LLMs respond to people is also strongly shaped by the language used towards them, and calling you "User" anywhere makes them default to a hollow and squishy assistant mode.

**Village** — the people in your life you've designated as trusted contacts. Your human support network, held in the Familiar's awareness.

**Villager** — a person you have defined as part of your Village in the internal database of the Familiar.

**The Familiar** — the AI companion themselves. Sometimes it refers to the software, but most often, it's used specifically to speak of the entities created within it.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to **[Zari Lewis](https://github.com/zarilewis)** for the original design of **entity-core** — the identity and memory architecture that Phylactery is directly based on, created as part of the [Psycheros](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros) project. None of the continuity work in Familiar would exist without that foundation.
