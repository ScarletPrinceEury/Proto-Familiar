/**
 * voice-web-adapter.js — the web `CallAdapter` (voice spec §6.4, Pass 2b).
 *
 * Transport only. It bridges ONE browser connection to the call engine and
 * nothing else: inbound audio and a push-to-talk release come off the socket
 * and go to the engine's hooks; the engine's spoken reply and control signals
 * go back down the socket. It never touches a session, an audience, or a model
 * — that is the engine's job (§3), which is what lets a second transport
 * (Discord, Pass 3) be a drop-in.
 *
 * ── The wire protocol (deliberately tiny) ───────────────────────────────
 * Browser → server:
 *   - binary frame            → 16 kHz mono s16le PCM for the current press
 *   - `{"t":"release"}`       → push-to-talk released: finalise this utterance
 *   - `{"t":"barge"}`         → my human started talking over the reply (2c)
 * Server → browser:
 *   - `{"t":"speak-start"}`   → a spoken reply begins (browser opens playback)
 *   - binary frame            → 24 kHz mono s16le TTS PCM to play
 *   - `{"t":"speak-end"}`     → the reply is complete
 *   - `{"t":"no-reply"}`      → the turn finished with nothing to say (reset the UI)
 *   - `{"t":"stop"}`          → stop playback now (barge-in)
 *
 * `send` is injected (the real one is a WebSocket's `send`), so the adapter is
 * testable without a socket — the same seam discipline as `call-engine.js`'s
 * `onTurn` and the push-adapter registry. A `reply` from the engine is an async
 * iterable of PCM Buffers (what the TTS worker streams); `null` means nothing
 * to say, which is a valid turn.

   * library delivers TEXT frames as Buffers too, so that check classified every
   * control frame (`{"t":"release"}`) as audio and fed it to the recogniser as
   * PCM — the release never fired, the utterance never finalised, and a held

   * as plain strings, a shape ws never actually sends.) `String(data)` decodes a
   * Buffer or a string equally, so parsing is shape-agnostic; routing must not be.

   * Never throws: a malformed control frame is logged and dropped, because a
   * browser bug must not take the call down.
