// it — a room is only as private as its least-trusted occupant. One

//
//   - No audience set (ward-private session) → 'ward-private'. This is
//     the only tag the memorization sweep treats as safe to route into
//     Phylactery; everything else stays in the local tome.
//   - Otherwise: each participant resolves to the category that
//     represents their access (their most-permissive category, since
//     multi-category membership unions). Unknown users fall to the
//     strangers floor. The tag is the least-permissive of those.
