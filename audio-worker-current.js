/**
 * The one live audio worker, and who is allowed to reach it.
 *
 * This used to live inside server.js, which was fine while the only thing that
 * spoke or listened was an HTTP endpoint. It stopped being fine the moment
 * Discord needed to hear a voice note too: a capability reachable from exactly
 * one surface is the shape of the bug RULE C exists to prevent — web got
 * `ensureDescribed`, Discord silently didn't, and I confidently described
 * images I had never looked at. So the worker moved out here, where every
 * surface can reach the same one, rather than each surface growing its own
 * wiring to drift out of step.
 *
 * ── Why it is built lazily and torn down on change ──────────────────────
 * Which engine speaks is a SETTING, and settings change while running. Build
 * at boot and a ward who installs voicebox and switches to it keeps hearing
 * the old engine until they restart. Build on demand and the switch takes
 * effect at the next thing they ask for.
 *
 * ── One at a time ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The old worker is stopped BEFORE the new one starts. Two engines holding
 * models at once is 400+ MB of ONNX on a machine that may have 8 GB, and the
 * reference laptop is the one I am built for, not a generous one.
