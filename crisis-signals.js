/**
 * Crisis-signal detector — pattern-based scoring of distress markers
 * in a user message. Step 4b of the caring spine.
 *
 * ⚠️  IMPORTANT BOUNDARIES
 *   - NOT a clinical tool. NOT a diagnostic. NOT a replacement for
 *     human judgment, professional care, or crisis services.
 *   - Heuristic only. Pattern-based. Will both miss real distress AND
 *     false-positive on idioms, hyperbole, jokes, and fiction.
 *   - Designed to flag for ELEVATED ATTENTION so the rest of the
 *     system (cadence, framing, break-through) can respond with more
 *     care — never to automate intervention.
 *
 * Tiers (additive within a single message; whole message capped):
 *   severe   — direct self-harm / suicidal ideation / acute plan
 *   high     — hopelessness, severe isolation, can't-continue
 *   moderate — severe distress, dissociation, panic
 *   mild     — sadness, worry, overwhelm
 *   safety   — explicit reassurance / engagement with support (negative weight)
 *
 * Each signal has:
 *   id, tier, weight, patterns[], example
 * Patterns are case-insensitive regexes. One match per signal per
 * message — multiple matches of the same signal don't double-count.
 *
 * Damping: context within ±50 chars of a match is scanned for
 *   - negation     ("don't", "never", "wouldn't")
 *   - hypothetical ("if someone", "what if", "imagine")
 *   - others       ("my friend said", "she told me")
 *   - hyperbolic   ("lol", "joking", "dying of laughter")
 *   - exertion     ("after my workout", "too much coffee", "so excited")
 *   - mundane      ("struggling with this build", "anxious about the deploy")
 *                  — exertion + mundane apply to NON-SEVERE signals ONLY;
 *                    they never damp a severe signal
 * A damped severe / high / moderate / mild signal contributes 0.2× its
 * weight (it still fires — intent is fuzzy, and we'd rather over-flag
 * than miss a real signal hidden in awkward phrasing). A damped SAFETY
 * signal contributes 0 — "I'm NOT okay" must not lower threat.
 *
 * The detector is intentionally auditable: every fired signal is
 * returned with its id, tier, raw weight, damped flag, and the
 * matched text, so the user / debugger can see exactly what triggered.
