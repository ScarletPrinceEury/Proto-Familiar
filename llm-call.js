/**
 * llm-call.js — one chat-completion call for the autonomous background loops.
 *
 * pondering / reach-out / memorization / tome-graduation each carried their own
 * byte-identical `defaultCallLLM` (differing only in temperature + max_tokens).
 * That duplication meant one shared bug: none handled THINKING models. On a
 * reasoning model (common via NanoGPT — GLM/DeepSeek think by default), the
 * chain-of-thought is billed against `max_tokens`, so a small cap (600–1200)
 * gets spent reasoning and the response comes back with an EMPTY
 * `message.content` — surfacing as the "Provider returned empty content" the
 * loops kept logging. This one helper fixes it in a single place:
 *
 *   - a generous default cap (a cap is free for non-thinking models — they stop
 *     when done — and gives a thinking model room to finish),
 *   - a fall back to `reasoning_content` / `reasoning` when `content` is empty
 *     (some proxies leave the answer only there), so a JSON-emitting caller can
 *     still find its object,
 *   - an error that names `finish_reason` so a genuine empty is DIAGNOSABLE
 *     ("finish_reason=length" = raise the cap) instead of a bare mystery.
 *
 * NOT used by the safety-critical triage path (cerebellum) — that call is
 * ward-signed and stays where it is; migrating it needs the ward's sign-off.
