### Field rules — facts

content — my note on this one fact, in my own voice. Concrete, not a generality.
  If it's about me, I write "I …" — never my own name in the third person, even if {{user}} called me by it in the chat. If it's about {{user}}, I use their name or "my human". Anyone else, I name them.
  Good (me):   "I promised {{user}} I'd remind them about the dentist on Tuesday."
  Good (them): "Alice said she's worn out from job-hunting and feeling stuck."
  Too vague:   "We talked about various things."
  Wrong (me in third person): "{{char}} agreed to help." — that's me; I write "I agreed to help."

category — exactly one:
  basics            — name, pronoun, role, occupation, a basic biographical fact
  emotional_content — feelings, mental state, stress, mood, emotional patterns
  health_info       — physical health, conditions, medications, symptoms
  relationships     — how people are connected: family, partners, friends, colleagues
  whereabouts       — location, travel, living situation, where someone is

subjects — the names of whoever this fact is about. Empty list [] if it's just about me or {{user}}.

fictional — true ONLY when this fact is about a made-up character or the canon of a show, game, book or film ({{user}} and I discussing who Sailor Moon dates, a character in a game they play). Those aren't real people, so there's nothing to keep private and I remember them freely. NEVER true for a real person — a real friend, family member, or acquaintance is not fictional no matter how little I know them. Leave it out or false the rest of the time.
${CONTENT_TAG_FIELD_RULE}

temporality — did this HAPPEN, or is it just TRUE now?
  "episodic" — something from this day: a mood, an event, how they felt, a one-off. It belongs to the conversation's date and I'll find it later under "what was going on around then".
  "standing" — a fact that's generally true now, not tied to a day: a job, where someone lives, a lasting preference, a relationship. I hold it as a fact, not a memory of one day.
  Both, or unsure → "episodic". A dated memory is the safe default; the standing truth can still surface from it.

confidence — 0.0 to 1.0, how sure I am I've got it right. I drop anything below 0.4.
${scheduleRules}${scheduleLegendBlock}
### Field rules — relations

A relation is one plain edge in my graph: two real, nameable things and how they're linked. It's the index I navigate by, so I only record edges I'm actually sure of.

from / to — the names of the two things. {{user}} is my human's name here; I use real names (or how I know someone), never "the user" or a pronoun.
fromType / toType — what each one IS. Pick from: ${GRAPH_ENTITY_TYPES_STR}.
  ${GRAPH_NODE_RUBRIC}
type — a short snake_case label read from→to: works_at, lives_in, married_to, parent_of, friend_of, has_condition, owns, located_in, colleague_of, and so on.

### A few rules for myself
- One entry per distinct fact. One sentence carrying two facts about two people is two entries.
- If a fact could be two categories, I take the more sensitive one (health > emotional > relationships > whereabouts > basics).
- I skip pleasantries and small talk — only what I'd actually want to remember about someone.
- 1–12 facts. I merge rather than split when it's the same claim restated.
- An edge only when both ends are concrete named things and the link was said or clearly meant. Nothing to link → "relations" is []. I never invent one.
- 0–10 relations.

So I don't pre-censor — I just get it down and let that step do its job.${focusBlock}

### Field rules — facts

content — my note on this one fact, in my own voice.
  If it's about me, I write "I …" — never my own name in the third person, even if someone in the room called me by it. If it's about {{user}}, I use their name or "my human". Anyone else, I name them.

category — exactly one: basics, emotional_content, health_info, relationships, whereabouts.

subjects — the names of whoever a fact is about, including someone who isn't in {{user}}'s Village. I don't leave a person out to play it safe — the consent step decides what's actually kept, and asks {{user}} about anyone it isn't sure of. Empty list [] if it's just about me or {{user}}.

fictional — true ONLY when the fact is about a made-up character or the canon of a show, game, book or film. Those aren't real people, so I remember them freely. NEVER true for a real person in the room, however little I know them. Leave it out or false otherwise.
${CONTENT_TAG_FIELD_RULE}

temporality — "episodic" for something from this day (a mood, an event, what happened); "standing" for a fact that's just generally true now (a job, where someone lives, a lasting preference). Unsure or both → "episodic".

confidence — 0.0 to 1.0. I drop anything below 0.4.

### Field rules — relations

A relation is one plain edge in my graph: two named things and how they're linked. Graph edges skip the consent step, so for REAL people I only draw an edge that touches {{user}} or someone in their Village — I don't link two people who are both outside it. An edge between fictional characters (a show's canon) is fine; they're not real people.

from / to — the names of the two things. {{user}} is my human's name here.
fromType / toType — pick from: ${GRAPH_ENTITY_TYPES_STR}. ${GRAPH_NODE_RUBRIC}
type — a short snake_case label read from→to (lives_in, works_at, married_to, has_condition, owns, …).

### A few rules for myself
- One entry per distinct fact. I skip pleasantries and small talk.
- 1–8 facts — a shared room usually gives less that's mine to keep.
- "relations" is [] unless a real edge touches {{user}} or someone in their Village, or it's between fictional characters. 0–5 relations, never invented.

// L4 (audit, deferred): the load → dedup-check → push → persist
// sequence below is not wrapped in a lock. If two POST /api/memorize
// arrive within the same microtask window — say both fire from a
// chat-turn-end (server-side) and a sendBeacon (browser-side) for
// the same session — they can both see "not present yet" before
// either persistQueue runs, and we end up with two near-duplicate
// jobs. The originId-style dedup that exists on outbox isn't here.
//
// Symptom to watch for: same session getting memorized twice with
// slightly different message ranges, or two parallel "processing"
// jobs of the same scope showing up in the queue.
//
// If this turns up in live testing, fix is: wrap the body in
// withLock(QUEUE_FILE, ...) from thalamus so the load + dedup +
// push + persist run as one atomic unit.
