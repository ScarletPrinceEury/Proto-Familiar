/**
 * Does merging sentences into one utterance stop my voice drifting?
 *
 * ── What this is testing ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * GenerateSingleSentence opens with `model_->GetLmMainInitState()`. The LM
 * state is RESET for every sentence, so each one is a fresh trajectory that
 * conditions on the voice embedding once and then goes its own way. My human
 * heard exactly that: sentence one always muffled, quiet and slow; sentence
 * two clearer and firmer; sentence four on a different apparent gender and
 * accent — and IDENTICALLY at every temperature, because none of it is
 * random. It is a deterministic function of which sentence it is.
 *
 * MergeShortSentences accumulates sentences until the buffer reaches
 * min_char_in_sentence, so raising that means fewer utterances, fewer resets,
 * fewer places to drift, and the model's settling-in cost paid once per
 * message rather than once per sentence.
 *
 * ── Why this is a probe and not a default ───────────────────────────────
 * Upstream's own limits (200 chars a sentence, 500 frames) suggest this model
 * is tuned for sentence-scale generation. Pushing a whole message through one
 * trajectory might hold the voice steady, or might degrade in some new way
 * near the end. I cannot hear it from here, and guessing is what produced the
 * last number I had to walk back. So: render the candidates, and my human
 * decides.
 *
 * Seed, clip, steps and temperature are held still — a difference between two
 * files is the chunking and nothing else.
 *
