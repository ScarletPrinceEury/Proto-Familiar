/**
 * Render the same words at several temperatures, so the choice is made by ear.
 *
 * `temperature` feeds the noise generator (`stddev = sqrt(temperature)`) and
 * is the one remaining lever on how steady my voice is once the seed is
 * fixed. Upstream's default is 0.7. Lower should mean less variation between
 * sentences; too low and delivery goes flat and lifeless.
 *
 * "Should" and "too low" are the problem. Nobody has measured where that line
 * falls for THIS reference clip, and a number picked because it sounds
 * plausible is exactly the kind of value that has no business being a default.
 * So this renders the candidates and my human listens.
 *
 * Everything except temperature is held still — same seed, same clip, same
 * steps, same text — so a difference between two files is the temperature and
 * nothing else.
