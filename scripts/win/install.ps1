# Proto-Familiar Windows installer
#
# Fresh install: auto-installs Node, Deno, Git, and uv. winget is the
#   preferred path (silent, per-user, no admin) but each tool has a
#   fallback path when winget is absent/broken — Deno + uv via their
#   official PowerShell one-liners, Node + Git via opening the
#   download page and waiting for the user to confirm. Then runs
#   `npm install`, clones entity-core (release tag), pre-caches its
#   Deno module graph, syncs Unruh's Python venv, and creates Desktop
#   + Start Menu shortcuts.
#
# Update mode: triggered automatically when node_modules\ already exists.
#   Takes a defensive backup of tomes\, logs\, entity-core data\, and
#   .proto-familiar-config.json into .pf-backups\<timestamp>\ BEFORE
#   any git op runs, then pulls latest Proto-Familiar
#   (`git pull --ff-only`), refreshes entity-core to the pinned tag,
#   and re-runs the idempotent npm install + deno cache + uv sync.
#   Node / Deno / Git / uv auto-install still runs if any is missing.
#
# Shortcut creation runs in BOTH modes — it's idempotent (skip if the
#   .lnk already exists). Previously gated on install-mode only, which
#   meant a fresh-clone-with-preserved-node_modules (common after a
#   Windows reinstall that left user dirs intact) silently skipped
#   making the Desktop / Start Menu shortcuts.
#
# Robustness layer (added in 0.3.2-alpha — bluebell-tester install
# silently failed with "logs are empty"):
#   * Every install run appends to .proto-familiar-install.log via
#     Start-Transcript, so a closed console / killed PS child still
#     leaves a visible breadcrumb the user can find without effort.
#   * Pre-flight checks catch the common silent-killer environments
#     before they cascade into a confusing downstream error — OneDrive
#     sync path, restricted PowerShell (AppLocker / WDAC / Constrained
#     Language Mode), unreachable hosts, long install paths, and
#     Mark-of-the-Web zone identifiers on a downloaded-ZIP install.
#   * Every install run ends with a Windows MessageBox showing status,
#     warnings, and the log path, so a frustrated user who closes the
#     console immediately still sees one clear actionable popup.
