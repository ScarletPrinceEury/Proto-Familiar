/**
 * The voice catalogue — which reference clips ship with me, and on what terms
 * (voice spec §6.5, and the licensing question it never answered).
 *
 * PocketTTS clones a voice zero-shot from a short reference clip, so "my
 * voice" is a *wav file*, not a model weight. That makes voice selection a
 * licensing question the moment we ship any of them, and it makes the
 * licence a property of each voice rather than a footnote about the project.
 *
 * ── Why this is code and not a note in a README ─────────────────────────
 * Proto-Familiar is GPL-3.0-or-later. A GPL distribution may not carry a
 * component whose licence forbids commercial use: the NC restriction would
 * propagate a limit on what recipients may do with the whole thing, which is
 * exactly what the GPL exists to prevent. That rule is easy to state and easy
 * to forget six months later when someone adds "just one more nice voice."
 * So `shippableVoices()` filters on the licence field and a test asserts no
 * non-redistributable source can reach the shipped set. The rule enforces
 * itself.
 *
 * Attribution is handled the same way: a voice that requires credit carries
 * who to credit, and `attributionNotice()` generates the NOTICE text from the
 * catalogue — so a credit cannot be silently dropped by editing prose.
 *
 * (Not legal advice — this encodes the terms each upstream source states.
 * Where a source's own wording is uncertain, we treat it as unusable.)

 *
 * Identical pitch, duration and voiced fraction: it is the same person saying
 * the same words. But ~23% more high-frequency energy, which is what "less
 * muffled" measures as. The lower sample rate is not a loss here — the model
 * resamples to 24 kHz regardless, so the only thing 48 kHz bought was room
 * noise at frequencies nothing keeps.
