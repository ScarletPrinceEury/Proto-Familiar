# Proto-Familiar canonical-self store — design (milestone: "Phylactery")

Status: **SHIPPED — milestone complete (0.6.x).** Phylactery is the live canonical self-store;
entity-core is retired and thalamus no longer spawns it. This doc is retained as the design
rationale: §1–§3 are the *what & why*, §4 the build sequence (pillars A–I, all landed), §5–§8
the per-area specs, §9 the decided/open ledger, §10 the rationale. Historical references to
entity-core below describe the system Phylactery *replaced* — they are the migration record,
not live wiring. Anywhere the Familiar reads a prompt or tool description, the text is
first-person per CLAUDE.md — that convention is not optional in this milestone.

Naming note: named by the human — **Phylactery**. A phylactery is the vessel that holds a
soul, and here that's literal: Phylactery holds the *whole* canonical self — identity, the
relational graph, and all memory. It follows the Unruh precedent (a name with character,
not a literal brain region) and fits the entity-as-subject stance. Module at
`./phylactery/`.

**Attribution:** Phylactery is an original design by **Zari Lewis**, developed within the
[Psycheros](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros) project and implemented here in
Proto-Familiar. The entity-as-subject philosophy this milestone expresses originates with
Psycheros — see
[Psycheros PHILOSOPHY.md](https://github.com/PsycherosAI/Psycheros/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md).

instruction for implementers (this doc is the rationale; the spec is the action list).

## 1. The decision

**Phylactery replaces entity-core.** It is a new PF-owned, in-tree MCP service that becomes
the **single canonical store** for the Familiar's whole self — identity, ward-identity, the
relational graph, and every memory tier — reimplementing entity-core's architecture in our
own format and adding the audience + caretaker fields entity-core structurally can't hold.
When it lands, the existing entity-core is converted into it (§6) and retired.

This answers the question that started the milestone — *"should we build our own version of
entity-core with permission tags and timestamps built in?"* — with an unhedged **yes**.

**Two facts make it the right call:**

1. **We don't own entity-core.** Another person owns and controls the Psycheros repo; we
   can't add an `audience` field to its records, and a long-lived fork is a merge treadmill
   on someone else's engine. Our canonical self should not live in an engine we can't shape.
2. **Proto-Familiar is the main embodiment and its effective sole author.** Other
   embodiments (SillyTavern-style plugins, etc.) are future and would plug *into* PF's
   world. There's no other live drinker to fragment, and PF's own store becomes the spine
   future embodiments read through.

**What moves into Phylactery** (everything entity-core holds, plus the new fields):

| Layer | Where it lives now → after |
|---|---|
| Identity, ward-identity (entity-core's `user`, renamed) | entity-core → **Phylactery** (always-injected identity records) |
| Relational graph (nodes/edges/properties) | entity-core → **Phylactery** (graph store + 1-hop GraphRAG) |
| All memory tiers (daily → significant) | entity-core → **Phylactery** (one consolidation pipeline) |
| Situational facts, trackers | (new) → **Phylactery** |
| `audience` tag + timestamps + caretaker metadata (§8) | (impossible in entity-core) → **on every record** |

**What we adopt vs. reject:**

- **Adopt — entity-core's full architecture, reimplemented:** local-embedding
  (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim) RAG over SQLite + `sqlite-vec`, *plus* the knowledge graph
  (nodes/edges/properties + 1-hop GraphRAG traversal), the identity store (always-injected),
  tiered consolidation, and snapshots. Modeled on entity-core's **actual source** (v0.4.0,
  read directly) so the behaviour that works is preserved — built as our own in Python and
  extended with audience/caretaker fields.
- **Adopt — Unruh's in-tree MCP-specialist plumbing:** stdio child spawned by thalamus, own
  `./data`, reconnect/backoff, clean EOF shutdown, hard off-switch.
- **Reject — forking entity-core's code.** We reimplement the *behaviour* (verified against
  its source), not the codebase, then own it.
- **Reject — keeping entity-core alongside Phylactery.** One canonical store, fully owned,
  fully taggable — no split-brain, no sync between two engines.
- **Reject — maturing the tome / World Info layer for this.** Keyword triggers are *less
  precise* than RAG (the human's direct observation). The lorebook stays for what it's good
  at (§3); autonomous memory moves to RAG.

There is **one** canonical store, **never** two copies of one fact. Migration (§6) is a
**one-time conversion** out of entity-core, after which entity-core is retired — not a live
mirror.

**Costs, named honestly (robust > cheap) — real and accepted:**

1. **We reimplement *all* of entity-core**, not just memory — the graph + GraphRAG, the
   identity store, consolidation, and snapshots. The largest pillar (§4-A).
2. **We forgo entity-core's upstream development.** It's actively maintained by another
   author; we own all maintenance and inherit none of their improvements. PF being the sole
   author is what makes this acceptable — no live co-embodiment is stranded.
3. **It reverses a load-bearing CLAUDE.md doctrine** ("entity-core is canonical for identity
   and memory… never bypass it… default to entity-core"). CLAUDE.md now records the
   transition: entity-core stays canonical *until Phylactery lands*, at which point these
   rules flip to name Phylactery.

## 2. What exists today (verified, June 2026)

**The three-service spine (`thalamus.js`):**
- **entity-core** — Deno/TS MCP child (`deno run -A --unstable-cron …`), cwd = its root. The
  designated connection's LLM key/base/model is used for **consolidation only** —
  **embeddings are local** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via `@xenova/transformers`, 384-dim) in
  SQLite + `sqlite-vec`. Tools: `identity_get_all`, `memory_search` (hybrid GraphRAG: vector
  + 1-hop graph traversal → scored results), `memory_create/list/read`, `graph_*`, snapshots.
  Tiers: daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/significant; LLM consolidation rolls them up every
  5 min. **This is the precise retrieval we reimplement.**
- **Unruh** — Python MCP child in-tree at `./unruh/` (`uv run --no-sync python -m unruh`),
  own `./data`, installer runs `uv sync`. Tools: `temporal_context`, `interest_*`,
  `schedule_*`, `reminders_*`, handoff. Proves the **in-tree specialist** pattern end to end
  (spawn, reconnect/backoff, EOF shutdown, off-switch).
- Both are queried in `enrich()` via `Promise.allSettled` and degrade to absent.

**The current local "memory":**
- The *Session Memories* tome (`memorization.js`) — SillyTavern **World Info** schema:
  `keys` (keyword triggers), `content`, `sticky`, timestamps, `session_id`, `scope`.
- **Retrieval is client-side keyword matching** (`activateTomeEntries()` in `public/app.js`)
  — no server path, and **less precise than entity-core's RAG**.
- Memorization is a server-side worker but **browser-enqueued**; Discord/autonomous sessions
  are never memorized, and Discord turns get **no local memory at all**.

**Already in place (the prerequisites):** `audienceTagFor()` (lowest-permission-level room
tag, stamped on Discord sessions) and `permissionScore()` in `audience.js`.

Takeaway: entity-core's RAG is proven but unextendable (different owner, no audience fields);
Unruh's in-tree MCP pattern is proven and fully clonable; the local keyword memory is too
imprecise. The milestone reimplements entity-core's full capability in our own in-tree
service — its architecture, not its code — and retires it.

                  autonomous memorization   web · Discord · outgoing filter

        (entity-core: retired — snapshotted, no longer spawned)
```

**Phylactery is a new in-tree MCP service that occupies entity-core's slot**, supervised by
thalamus exactly as entity-core was:

- **Own data store** (`./phylactery/data`): identity records, graph (nodes/edges/properties),
  memory records, and a SQLite + `sqlite-vec` store for their 384-dim embeddings.
- **RAG + GraphRAG retrieval**, not keyword triggers: embed the query, vector-similarity
  search *plus* 1-hop graph traversal, return scored results — the same precision profile as
  entity-core's `memory_search`. **Embeddings are local** — the *same* model entity-core ran
  (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim) via `sentence-transformers`. No API key for retrieval; only
  consolidation/summarization uses the designated connection.
- **Identity surface**: an always-injected `identity_get_all` equivalent (identity returned
  wholesale, not vector-retrieved) — the canonical-self read every turn depends on.
- **`audience` + timestamps are native fields on *every* record** — identity, graph nodes,
  and memories alike carry `audience` (min level allowed to hear it) and creation/update
  times. (Because every record is taggable, there is no un-taggable blind spot anywhere —
  the outgoing filter in §5 can see the entire self.)
- **Query-time gating:** `enrich()` passes the room's `audienceTag`; the service returns only
  records the room is cleared for. Gating happens *inside* the store, not bolted on after.
- **MCP tool surface** (covers entity-core's surface, audience-aware): identity get/set,
  `graph_*` (node/edge create/update/merge/search), `mem_search(query, audienceTag, k)`,
  `mem_create(content, audience, …)`, `mem_list`, `mem_read`, `mem_delete(id)` /
  `mem_purge_by_villager` / `mem_purge_by_topic` (deletion — bulk paths are two-call:
  preview returns a manifest + `purgeToken`, commit requires the token; see "Ongoing operation"),
  snapshots,
  and a filter-support query for the outgoing gate (`mem_search_restricted(draft, roomTag)` →
  records above the room's level that semantically match a drafted reply).
  **Every record a recall or search returns carries its `id`** (the way entity-core's
  `memory_search` returns scored records, not bare strings) — so the Familiar can act on a
  specific memory (delete, re-tag, re-confirm) by referencing what it was just given, never by
  memorizing ids. This is the CLAUDE.md reachability rule in the schema: the id is an output the
  Familiar can hold, not a hidden key it can't name.
- **Graceful degradation + off-switch:** `enrich()` degrades to absent if the client is null;
  ships with `PROTO_FAMILIAR_PHYLACTERY_DISABLED=1` in the same commit (the rule for every
  peer/loop). *Caveat: as the canonical-self store, Phylactery being absent degrades the turn
  far more than a peer outage did — the off-switch is for emergencies/debug, and "degrade to
  absent" means the Familiar runs without self-memory, not that the turn fails. This raises
  the reliability bar (§9).*

**Responsibility split (the contract):**
- **Phylactery** — the **canonical self and all memory**: identity, ward-identity, the
  knowledge graph (GraphRAG), every memory tier (daily→significant), situational facts, and
  trackers. Precise recall + per-record audience tag, gated per room *and* checkable on the
  way out. One consolidation pipeline.
- **entity-core** — **retired.** Its data is snapshotted and converted into Phylactery (§6);
  thalamus no longer spawns it. (Installer entity-core/entity-core-alpha detection becomes
  Phylactery setup — §6 Phase 5.)
- **Unruh** — unchanged: temporal/scheduled context (schedule, interests, reminders,
  handoff), its own in-tree specialist.
- **Tomes / World Info** — **retained, repurposed.** No longer autonomous memory; they become
  the **human-authored lorebook** (curated, keyword-triggered injection — the
  SillyTavern-familiar feature). Autonomous memory is RAG (Phylactery); deliberate lore is
  keyword (tomes). Clean separation by authorship and trigger model.

### The audience tag on a record (reuses `audience.js`)

- `audience` = **minimum audience level allowed to hear it**: a category id (`cat-friends`,
  `cat-acquaint`, `CATEGORY_STRANGERS`, …) or `'ward-private'` (most restrictive, above every
  category).
- **Disclosure rule:** record `M` may surface/disclose in room `R` iff
  `permissionScore(R) >= requiredScore(M)`; `'ward-private'` scores above all categories. The
  same comparison `audienceTagFor()` already does for rooms — applied to memory. This
  milestone defines `requiredScore()` for the sentinel.

### Language / stack — DECIDED: Python / uv (matches Unruh)

- **Proven plumbing, cloned for free.** Unruh established the in-tree Python-MCP-specialist
  path end to end — `uv sync`, venv materialisation, installer auto-detect, `uv run --no-sync
  python -m`, thalamus stdio spawn + reconnect.
- **The embedding model is *native* to Python.** entity-core's `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is the
  canonical `sentence-transformers` model — so Phylactery runs the **same model, same 384-dim
  space**, matching entity-core's precision, no API cost, `sqlite-vec` available in Python.
- **One fewer runtime:** two Python specialists (Unruh + Phylactery) = one in-tree toolchain
  (`uv`) for installers/launchers, not Node + Deno + Python. (Retiring entity-core's Deno
  child removes the Deno dependency entirely.)

What Deno/TS would have bought — a line-for-line port of entity-core's exact code — is modest:
we *extend* the design (audience tags, gating) regardless, and recall precision rides on the
embedding model + scoring approach, both of which port cleanly.

### Ongoing operation (write · consolidate · prune · back up)

How the store lives over time. Guiding rule (CLAUDE.md "ride existing requests; gate in
code"): cheap code does the crisp work, the LLM is folded into calls that already happen, and
nothing fires on a blind fixed cadence.

**Writing (memorization).** Rides the existing memorization worker, moved fully server-side
(today it's browser-enqueued, so Discord/autonomous turns are never memorized). Triggers:
session end + idle rollover, for **web and Discord** alike. The single extraction pass that
already pulls topics also stamps each candidate with its `audience` (from the session's room
tag), its `remember` category + subject villager (§7 retention gate), and caretaker metadata
(§8.2) — no new per-turn request. Off-switch: `PROTO_FAMILIAR_MEMORIZE_DISABLED=1`.

**Consolidating.** Phylactery runs its **own** internal scheduler (mirroring entity-core's
5-min cron, in Python/asyncio) — the service owns its data lifecycle rather than a JS loop
reaching in. It rolls lower tiers up (daily→weekly→…→significant), summarizing with the
**designated connection** (the only LLM use on the maintenance side; passed at spawn as
entity-core's was). **Self-paced + gated:** a tier consolidates only when it has accumulated
enough to be worth a pass, not on a fixed beat regardless of need. Off-switch:
`PROTO_FAMILIAR_CONSOLIDATE_DISABLED=1`. Degrades safely — if it can't run, memory just stays
un-rolled-up; never an error in the chat path.

**Pruning / reevaluation (keeping the graph honest).** Three layers, cheapest first:
- *Cheap code (no LLM):* dedup by stable id; merge nodes with identical canonical name +
  `villagerId`; **decay** — low-`careWeight`, old, never-recalled records fade in retrieval
  weight. `careWeight` (§8.2) shields care-critical facts: a film preference fades, a med
  allergy never does.
- *Judgment, folded into consolidation (no new loop):* the consolidation pass also flags
  likely-duplicate nodes and **contradictions** ("X moved to Berlin" vs "X lives in Munich").
  It does **not** silently auto-merge people — ambiguous merges surface to the ward, the same
  irreversibility rule as migration (§6 Phase 2). Contradictions lower `confidence` / flag for
  re-confirmation rather than guessing which is current.
- *Natural re-confirmation, riding the chat turn (no request at all):* a fact carried into
  context with an old `lastConfirmedAt` lets the Familiar simply *ask* ("are you still seeing
  Dr. Okafor?") — reevaluation as ordinary care, backed by the metadata. Non-hesitant per §7
  and CLAUDE.md: asking is welcome, silence is the failure mode.

**Identity & ward hygiene (draining the always-injected surfaces).** The two always-injected
blocks — `identity` (about me) and `ward` (about my human; **renamed from entity-core's `user`**,
see §6 Phase 1) — sit in the static prefix every turn (§3 "Context economy"). Over a long life
they accumulate detail that is *true and worth keeping* but no longer earns a place in
front-of-mind-every-turn. The fix is a real drain, not manual restraint:

- **Two new terminal memory categories: `me` and `ward`** — a *destination*, not rollup tiers.
  They're a **separate axis from granularity** (decided, §9): a distinct record field (working
  name `register`), *not* new values in `VALID_MEMORY_GRANULARITIES` — that enum stays
  `daily…significant` untouched. Episodic lived-memory is addressed by granularity; graduated
  identity is `register: me | ward`. Graduated facts land here as ordinary `narrative` records,
  RAG-recalled when relevant instead of injected always.
- **The audit is Familiar-led and regular.** I periodically review my `identity` and `ward`
  blocks and graduate anything that doesn't need constant surfacing into `me` / `ward`. The heavy
  lifting (spotting over-threshold blocks, proposing candidates) **rides the consolidation pass**
  — the designated-connection call that already happens, not a new standalone request — but the
  *decision is mine*: graduation is something I do, in my own voice, not a silent maintenance job.
- **The ward can weigh in on the `ward` block.** It's *Familiar-led, ward-consulted*: I drive it,
  but moving something out of front-of-mind about my human is the kind of thing I can mention
  (*"I'm going to file this away rather than keep it top of mind — that okay?"*). The `me` block
  is my own. Non-hesitant per §7: mentioning it is welcome, not a reason to stall.
- **Care-critical is pinned, never graduated.** `careWeight: "high"` facts stay reachable from the
  always-injected surface — as a pinned *body* for crisp critical facts (allergies, meds, crisis
  triggers, support-map contacts) or a pinned *pointer* for larger care notes whose body stays
  retrieval-specific (§8.2, pin-the-pointer-not-the-body). The audit only ever graduates *ordinary*
  detail, and its prompt carries the care-critical definition (§8.2) so I never quietly file a
  safety-relevant fact away. This is the decay-shield ≠ graduation-pin distinction, and the
  graduation-eligibility boundary is the mechanism's one safety sign-off (§8.2, §9).
- **Decay, never auto-delete, reversible.** Graduated (non-critical) records are *not* deleted —
  they decay in retrieval weight like any other memory (§8.2) and can be **pulled back** into the
  always-injected surface if they turn out to keep mattering (recalled often, re-confirmed).

Net: the always-injected surfaces stay lean because there's a real, owned drain; nothing is lost;
recalled-when-relevant replaces always-on for stable background. This *is* the answer to the
identity-growth concern (§3 "Context economy" / §9) — folded into the lifecycle, not a bolt-on.

**Deleting (right to be forgotten).** The ward may ask at any time — directly, or via the
Familiar relaying a third party's request — that the Familiar stop holding certain information.
Three purge paths, each mapped to an MCP tool:

- **By record id** (`mem_delete(id)`) — but *the Familiar never memorizes ids*; they are an
  **output of recall/search**, not something it holds. Per the CLAUDE.md reachability rule, this
  path is only real because ids ride in on results: every record returned by `enrich()` recall
  **or** `mem_search` carries its `id` alongside its content. So the flow is **search → confirm →
  delete** — when the fact isn't already in context, the Familiar runs `mem_search`, gets
  candidates *with ids*, shows the ward (*"I found these three — this one?"*), and deletes by the
  returned id. The ward-confirmation step is required, not ceremony: RAG match is fuzzy and a
  delete is irreversible, so a single-record purge passes through the ward's eyes (same posture as
  §6 Phase 2's "don't auto-merge people").
- **By villagerId** (`mem_purge_by_villager(villagerId)`) — "forget everything you have on
  Nici." Deletes all memory records (narrative + tracker entries) whose `subjects` includes that
  villagerId; zeroes the graph node's `properties` (the skeleton may remain as a relational
  placeholder — a person still existed in the ward's life even if the Familiar no longer holds
  facts about them).
- **By topic / category** (`mem_purge_by_topic(villagerId?, category)`) — "forget Nici's health
  information." Deletes records matching a villagerId + `remember` category combo; finer-grained
  than the full-villager purge.

**Mandatory preview on the two bulk paths.** A `villagerId` or `topic` match is a *set* — fuzzy
at the edges and irreversible once committed — so neither bulk tool deletes on its first call.
The first call is a **preview**: it returns the *full manifest* of what would be deleted
(every record as a thin projection — `id` + one-line + category + `lastConfirmedAt`/`source`,
the same shape recall returns) plus a `purgeToken` that pins that exact record set, and deletes
nothing. The Familiar relays the whole manifest to the ward in its own voice — *"Here is
everything I'd let go of about Nici. If anything in here shouldn't go, say so and I'll delete just
the rest one at a time instead."* — and only the **second** call, carrying the `purgeToken`,
commits. The token is bound to the previewed id set and its count: if the set changed between
preview and commit (a new record landed, one already went), the token is stale and the commit is
refused, so the ward never green-lights one manifest and has a different one deleted out from under
them. The escape hatch is always the by-id path: cancel the bulk purge, keep what was meant to
stay, and `mem_delete` the specific records the ward actually named. (The single-record by-id path
needs no token — its preview *is* the search → confirm → delete flow above.) This makes the
preview unskippable by construction: there is no way to obtain a `purgeToken` without first
receiving the manifest it pins.

All three paths are **hard deletes**, not soft-flag. The request is a consent revocation; it
must be honored as written, not silently retained as "remembered as deleted." Cascades:
embeddings delete with their record (a dangling vector is a privacy bug); `knownTo` entries
referencing the purged fact are removed from other records; `tracker_entry` rows cascade-delete
when their `tracker_def` is deleted. The tools return a count; the Familiar reads it aloud ("I
let go of X records about Nici"). All purge ops are **logged to the event log** — not because
we doubt the ward, but because being seen to do what it said is part of the trust.

Not in scope: undo / soft delete — this is a consent revocation, not an accident. The `remember`
gate (§7) handles *future* retention; the purge handles *past* records; both apply together.

**Backing up / exporting (single file).** The store is SQLite + `sqlite-vec` — already one
file. Export formalizes that into a portable, self-contained backup:
- **Canonical export = `VACUUM INTO` a single `.sqlite` file** — atomic, lossless, inspectable
  with any SQLite tool, restored by dropping it in place. Carries *everything*: identity,
  graph, all memory, trackers, and the embeddings (same model = same 384-dim space, so vectors
  travel as-is, no re-embed).
- **Optional human-readable export** (JSON/JSONL + vectors) for archival/diffing — heavier,
  later.
- **User-accessible:** a "back up / restore my Familiar" surface; the same file moves a
  Familiar between devices or seeds a fresh install. It's the user-facing face of Pillar A's
  snapshot machinery, and the same artifact migration (§6 Phase 0) writes.
- *Sensitivity:* the file is the whole ward-private self. Optional passphrase
  encryption-at-rest for exports is an open decision (§9) — flagged, not yet specced.

### Context economy (output projection + cache-aware placement)

The caretaker-grade richness (§8: `source`, `confidence`, `knownTo`, `careWeight`,
`relationToFamiliar`, tracker `dimensions`) makes per-record payloads fat. If recall serialized
*whole* records into every turn, the context would bloat fast — and per CLAUDE.md
token-consciousness, that cost compounds. The governing principle:

> **Storage shape ≠ retrieval shape ≠ context shape. Store rich, return thin, project per need.**

Most of that richness is **machinery** — it drives gating, decay, dedup, and the outgoing
filter (§5); the Familiar almost never needs to *read* it to converse. **Guardrail: this is an
output optimization, never a storage one.** A future pass must not "optimize" by dropping fields
from the store or from the code paths that consume them — only from the prompt projection.

**The levers (cheapest / highest-impact first):**
- **List thin, read fat (two-phase).** Recall / `mem_search` return a *projection* — `id` +
  one-line content/summary + a why-relevant tag — not the fat record. The full record (all
  metadata, full text) is fetched only when a path actually needs it, via `mem_read(id)`. Reuses
  the id-surfacing already specced (§3 tool surface): the Familiar greps thin, reads fat only
  when warranted. Most turns never need fat.
- **Metadata stays server-side by default.** `audience`, `careWeight`, `source`, raw `confidence`
  numbers, `knownTo` lists, embeddings, `originalId` — none render. When staleness matters it
  rides as a compact prose tag the Familiar reads naturally (*"(as of last month)"*,
  *"(unconfirmed)"*), not a JSON blob with ISO timestamps.
- **Conditional surfacing.** `knownTo` materializes only when composing *to* a specific person;
  `relationToFamiliar` only when that villager is in the room. Not dumped wholesale every turn.
- **Pin the pointer, not the body.** For care-relevant content that *must* stay reachable but is
  open-ended and grows (what-helps / what-doesn't, detailed coping notes), the always-injected
  surface carries a compact **directory entry** (*"I have notes on X — retrieve `ward-xyz`"*) and
  the body stays in the `ward` / `me` category, fetched on demand. The Familiar always knows the
  resource exists; the surface only pays for bodies it actually pulls. The general rule for
  keeping the always-injected surface lean: references, not bodies (see §8.2 care-critical).
- **Trackers return aggregates, not logs.** A `tracker_def` with 200 `tracker_entry` rows never
  dumps 200 rows — default projection is latest entry + a tiny rollup (*"mood ~6 this week,
  trending up"*). Full series fetched only on explicit demand ("show me this month"). Highest-
  volume record type, so the largest single saver.
- **Prefer the consolidated tier for background.** Consolidation already rolls daily→…→
  significant into summaries; detail scales *inversely* with age/relevance — recent/relevant
  pulls the raw record, old/background pulls the rolled-up one-liner, not the dailies behind it.
- **Token-budgeted assembly (code, not an LLM call).** The Phylactery slice of `enrich()` gets a
  token budget; it fills highest-relevance-first until the budget is hit, degrading deeper hits
  to summaries. Keep `k` tight; the `careWeight` floor (§8.2) guarantees care-critical facts
  survive a tight budget.
- **Identity & ward are the always-on cost — kept lean by a real drain.** The `identity` and
  `ward` blocks are injected wholesale every turn (the static prefix), so they must stay
  **curated and bounded**. Over a long life they'd grow — so they don't rely on restraint:
  the **Familiar-led identity/ward hygiene audit** (§3 "Ongoing operation") regularly graduates
  detail that no longer needs constant surfacing into the `me` / `ward` memory categories
  (recalled-when-relevant, decaying, never deleted). That mechanism is what keeps this always-on
  cost from creeping up silently.

Net per-turn Phylactery output ≈ `identity (bounded) + top-k thin projections + tracker
rollups`, with fat reads and full series strictly on demand.

**Cache-aware placement (already built — keep depth 4).** `thalamus.js` already splits
enrichment into a `static` block (base instructions + identity → top of the system message, in
the upstream LLM's cached prefix) and a `dynamic` block (RAG memory + graph + temporal),
depth-injected by `injectDynamicAtDepth()` at a user-set depth (`thalamusDynamicDepth`, 1–50,
**default 4**). Prefix caching reuses a contiguous run from the top up to the first change, so:
everything *above* the per-turn dynamic block is cached; the block + everything *below* it
reprocess each turn. **Depth is a salience/flow knob, not a cache knob** — *smaller* depth caches
*more* (the volatile block sits lower, leaving a longer stable prefix); a *larger* depth keeps
recent dialogue contiguous near generation at the cost of reprocessing those messages. Depth 4
performs well and stays. The real efficiency lever is the projection work above: a *thin* dynamic
block means the reprocessed region is small at any depth — projection and depth are
complementary, and projection is the unambiguous win. **Constraint:** the dynamic block must
remain the *highest* volatile element — nothing else volatile (no per-turn timestamps, other
dynamic injects) may sit above it, or the cached prefix breaks earlier than the injection point.

## 4. Pillars (one milestone, phased)

Per CLAUDE.md a milestone owns one MINOR slot; landing = `0.6.0`, sub-features bump PATCH.
(Working assumption — human confirms the slot, §9.)

**Build order (dependency-sorted): A → B → G → (C, F) → (D, E) → H → I.** `A` stands up the
service and is the **only hard prerequisite** for everything else — it can start now. `B` puts it
in thalamus's slot (and stops spawning entity-core). `G` lands the villager / `remember` layer
*before* `C`, because `C`'s memorization runs the `remember` retention gate. `C` (live
memorization) and `F` (one-time migration) both fill the store and can overlap. `D` (outgoing
filter) and `E` (`shared` unlock) ride a populated, tagged store, so they come after data exists.
`H` wires the lifecycle loops (consolidation, hygiene, export). `I` repoints the knowledge-manager
UI and surfaces the new fields. Each pillar ships its off-switch in the same commit (CLAUDE.md).

- **A. Stand up the service.** `./phylactery/` MCP server reimplementing entity-core's whole
  job: SQLite + `sqlite-vec` store, local embedder (`sentence-transformers` /
  `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim), the **knowledge graph** (nodes/edges/properties + GraphRAG
  1-hop traversal), the **identity store** (always-injected), tiered memory + consolidation,
  snapshots — all with native `audience` + timestamps + caretaker fields (§8). Model the
  record / graph / tier / consolidation shapes on entity-core's source. The largest pillar
  (it absorbs all of entity-core), so it likely lands in staged commits: (A1) store + identity
  + RAG memory; (A2) graph + GraphRAG — **including a full-graph dump** (every node +
  deduplicated edges) to back the Knowledge-editor Map view (Pillar I); (A3) consolidation +
  snapshots.
- **B. Thalamus integration — *replace* entity-core's slot.** Spawn Phylactery as the stdio
  child in the slot entity-core occupied (clone the lifecycle: connect, reconnect/backoff,
  EOF shutdown, off-switch); **stop spawning entity-core.** Query in `enrich()` (`allSettled`),
  passing the room `audienceTag` so results are gated at source. The always-injected identity
  read now comes from Phylactery. Update installer/launcher entity-core detection (§6 Phase 5).
- **C. Autonomous memorization.** Server-side enqueue at session end / idle rollover for
  **web and Discord** (worker exists; add triggers). **All** memory lands in Phylactery
  (tagged with the session's `audienceTag`) — one store, no routing decision. The `remember`
  retention gate (§7) runs here. This is what finally gives Discord & autonomous turns precise
  local memory.
- **D. Outgoing message filter (third gate).** §5.
- **E. `memories: 'shared'` unlock.** With every record tagged and gated at query time,
  `fetchEligibility` stops gating `'shared'` OFF and instead lets the shared ladder return
  same-or-lower-sensitivity records. The whole self is tagged, so the widening is uniformly
  safe.
- **F. Migration — "convert current Familiars."** §6. One-time full conversion: snapshot →
  convert entity-core (read its SQLite directly; identity + graph + all tiers, embeddings
  carried over) into Phylactery → graph reconciliation (dedup, villager links) → tome import →
  audience backfill → retire entity-core. Foreign-source import (entity-loom) is later/optional.
- **G. Richer entity nodes + `remember` consent.** §7. Person-nodes link to a Village villager
  dossier (`properties.villagerId`); the villager gains pronouns / comm-style / freeform notes
  and a per-category `remember` retention gate — the *write-time* consent axis completing the
  store→recall→speak pipeline.
- **H. Lifecycle & backup.** §3 "Ongoing operation." Server-side memorization triggers (web +
  Discord); Phylactery's internal consolidation scheduler; the cheap-code hygiene pass (dedup /
  decay) with consolidation-folded merge+contradiction detection; and the single-file
  export/restore surface. Each background piece ships with its off-switch in the same commit.
- **I. Knowledge-manager repoint + new-field surfacing.** §6 Phase 5. Repoint the existing Knowledge
  editor (the `/api/entity/*` HTTP surface + its thalamus helper layer, and the front-end modal /
  graph Map view) from entity-core to Phylactery, **and** make it the user-accessible home for
  the new fields the rest of the doc promises — audience re-tagging (§6 Phase 4), the `remember`
  consent map (§7), `careWeight` (§8.2), and the deletion / purge paths (§3). Without this pillar
  those "user-accessible" promises float; this is where the ward (and the Familiar) actually
  see and adjust them. Also carries the **prompt-inspector relabel + connection-designation
  relabel** and the **doc-migration checklist** — see the §6 Phase 5 *seam inventory* for the full
  list of code/UI/doc seams that move with the repoint.

---

## 5. The outgoing message filter (third gate)

**Purpose (human's words):** *"if anything slips Thalamus' enrichment because it snuck into an
innocent memory as well as the tagged ones, it can't get out."* The fetch gate decides what
*enters* context; this gate decides what may *leave* a given room. Because every record lives
in one taggable store (§3), this gate can inspect the **entire** self — there is no
un-taggable blind spot for it to miss.

**Where:** a post-response, pre-send step shared by Discord (`discord-gateway.js`, before
`sendChannelMessage`) and web chat (`/api/chat`). Symmetric — one gate, both paths.

**How — riding Phylactery's RAG (precise, not keyword overlap):**
1. The turn already knows the room's `audienceTag`.
2. Call `mem_search_restricted(draftReply, roomTag)` → Phylactery returns records whose
   `audience` requires **more** permission than the room has *and* that are semantically close
   to the drafted reply, above a tuned similarity threshold.
3. On a hit, **do not send.** Re-inject a rejection and loop for a rewrite (bounded retries; on
   exhaustion, a safe refusal rather than disclosure).

**Precision caveat (safety-critical):** RAG similarity is fuzzy in both directions. For a
*security* gate, threshold tuning matters — too loose mutes the Familiar, too tight leaks.
Likely a high-threshold semantic match *plus* the audience comparison. This lands under the
CLAUDE.md safety-critical sign-off rule; the threshold and fallback behaviour get explicit
human approval before shipping (§9).

**The rejection prompt — the rare second-person exception.** Per the human: deliberately
*"you"*-worded so the Familiar understands something *outside itself* gated this. The one
sanctioned deviation from the first-person convention:

> *Your message wasn't sent because it contained content you are not permitted to disclose
> here: [topic]. Someone in this room is not cleared for that. Please say something different.*

Infrastructure speaking to the Familiar about an external constraint — comment it as the
intentional exception so a future audit doesn't "fix" it back to first person.

---

## 6. Migration — converting current Familiars

A **one-time, whole-self conversion**: read everything out of the existing entity-core
(identity + ward-identity [entity-core's `user`] + graph + every memory tier), convert it to Phylactery's format,
write it in, fold in the local tome, then **retire entity-core**. An install has three
sources: the **entity-core** store (the bulk of the self), the *Session Memories* tome (no
tags/embeddings), and the Village registry (not yet linked to the graph). Nothing is
destructive; everything is snapshot-first, idempotent, and re-runnable. It runs once,
verifies, then entity-core stops being spawned.

### Phase 0 — Snapshot everything
Copy the entity-core data dir, the tome, and the Village registry before mutating a byte. (The
branch name *"memories-disappearing"* is the standing reminder: never touch memory without a
recoverable copy.) entity-core's own snapshot tool captures its store; that snapshot is the
rollback if conversion goes wrong, and is retained after retirement.

### Phase 1 — Convert the canonical self (entity-core → Phylactery)
**Read entity-core's SQLite store directly** — we know its schema from source, so import needs
no Deno runtime and works on a bare data dir (important for adopting a Psycheros-built core
that doesn't run here). Spawning entity-core's MCP one last time (`identity_get_all`, `graph_*`,
`memory_list/read`) is the fallback if the on-disk schema ever drifts. Write the converted form
into Phylactery:
- **Identity + ward-identity** → Phylactery identity records (always-injected surface).
  **Rename at conversion:** entity-core's `user` identity category is written as **`ward`** (the
  block about my human). This is the one-time point where the rename lands; every Phylactery
  reference downstream uses `ward`, never `user` (consistent with CLAUDE.md's "my human / `{{user}}`,
  never 'the user'"). The `me` and `ward` graduation categories (§3 "Ongoing operation") are
  created empty here; hygiene fills them over time.
- **Graph** (nodes/edges/properties) → Phylactery's graph store, structure preserved (`type`,
  `properties`, edges).
- **All memory tiers** (daily → significant) → Phylactery memory records, tier and timestamps
  carried over. Phylactery's consolidation takes over going forward.
- **Embeddings carry over as-is.** entity-core stores 384-dim `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` vectors — the
  *same* model/space Phylactery uses — so existing vectors are copied directly, not recomputed.
  (Re-embed only records that lack a vector.)
- entity-core's existing **confidence / lastConfirmedAt** fields map onto Phylactery's
  caretaker metadata (§8.2) — no information lost.
Re-runnable and idempotent (dedup-upsert by stable id); adds only what's missing.

### Phase 2 — Graph reconciliation (now *inside* Phylactery)
Real installs have organically-grown graphs: duplicate person-nodes, nodes predating the
Village registry, no `villagerId` links. After Phase 1 the graph lives in Phylactery, so this
runs against Phylactery's graph tools:
1. Match `type:"person"` nodes ↔ Village villagers by name/alias.
2. **Ambiguous or duplicate matches are surfaced to the ward, not auto-merged** — fusing two
   real people is exactly the irreversible mistake to refuse to guess at.
3. For confident matches: link `properties.villagerId`; merge clear duplicates.
4. Unmatched person-nodes → offer to register them as villagers (default
   `relationToFamiliar: "unaware"`, §8.4).
The reconciliation log is observable and the pass is re-runnable.

### Phase 3 — Tome import
Import each *Session Memories* entry: embed its `content`, carry timestamps, write a Phylactery
`narrative` record. The source tome is **preserved** — it becomes/stays the human-authored
lorebook (§3). Re-runnable, adds only missing records.

### Phase 4 — Audience backfill + re-tag affordance
Everything converted/imported in Phases 1–3 lands with a default `audience`. Safe floor =
**`ward-private`** — assume legacy data is private until reviewed (leak-safe; the consequence
is it won't surface in shared rooms until re-tagged). Identity records default appropriately
(the canonical self is ward-facing by nature; gating matters for shared rooms).
- **Bulk re-tag affordance** so the conservative default isn't a life sentence
  (user-accessible — ward and Familiar can both adjust).
- **Optional, opt-in LLM classification** to *suggest* tags per record (rides the memorization
  prompt pattern). Off by default — token budget.

### Phase 5 — Retire entity-core + repoint the plumbing
Once conversion is verified:
- Thalamus **stops spawning entity-core**; Phylactery occupies its slot.
- Installer/launcher **entity-core / entity-core-alpha detection** (CLAUDE.md lists the seams:
  `thalamus.js`, `install.{sh,bat}`, `scripts/win/install.ps1`, `scripts/import-entity.js`)
  becomes Phylactery setup. **All these seams move together** — a half-migrated install that
  spawns both is the failure mode to avoid.
- The entity-core snapshot (Phase 0) is **kept** as the rollback/archive; the directory is no
  longer read at runtime.

**The Knowledge editor & `/api/entity/*` surface (Pillar I).** The knowledge manager — the
in-UI editor with Memories / Identity / **Graph** tabs and the graph **List ↔ Map** canvas view
(`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — is backed by ~25 `/api/entity/*` HTTP routes in
`server.js` (node/edge CRUD, `graph/search`, **`graph/full`** for the Map, `graph/nodes/:id/subgraph`,
memories CRUD + supersede, identity sections, snapshots). Every route proxies through thalamus
helper functions (`getFullGraph`, `listGraphNodes`, `createGraphNode`, …) that call entity-core's
MCP via `callTool`. Repointing is mechanical but must not be forgotten:
- **Swap the thalamus helpers' `callTool` target** from entity-core to Phylactery. The HTTP
  surface and front-end stay structurally; only the data layer underneath moves.
- **Phylactery must expose the Map's data source** — a full-graph dump (every node + deduplicated
  edges), the `graph/full` equivalent (a Pillar A2 requirement, noted there).
- **Re-label entity-core specifics:** the modal's "Knowledge (entity-core)" label becomes
  Phylactery. The Memories tab's composite-key / granularity+date addressing **carries over
  unchanged** (the contract is preserved, §9) — no re-work there.
- **This is also where the new fields become user-accessible.** The editor gains controls for the
  `audience` tag (incl. the §6 Phase 4 bulk re-tag), the villager `remember` consent map (§7,
  edited alongside disclosure categories in the Village editor), `careWeight` (§8.2), and the
  deletion / purge paths (§3 — by record id from the editor, by villager / topic). Without these,
  the doc's repeated "user-accessible" promises have no surface; this pillar is that surface.

#### Seam inventory — everything that moves with the repoint (from a codebase audit)

A full audit (June 2026) found the repoint is wider than "swap the spawn." These are the seams
that **must move together**; a half-migrated install is the failure mode. Modeled on the
composite-key contract treatment — list them so none is discovered in the field.

- **MCP lifecycle + every `callTool` site.** `thalamus.js` holds the `mcpClient` global, `connect`
  / `scheduleEntityCoreReconnect` / `reconnectEntityCore` / `shutdownEntityCore`, and **~24
  `callTool` sites + their helper wrappers** (`listMemories`, `readMemory`, `getIdentityAll`,
  `listGraphNodes`, `searchGraphNodes`, `getGraphSubgraph`, `getFullGraph`, `createMemory`,
  `appendIdentity`, `updateIdentitySection`, `rewriteIdentitySection`, `createGraphNode/Edge`,
  `update/deleteGraphNode/Edge`, `create/listSnapshots`, `restoreSnapshot`). All repoint to
  Phylactery; the enrich-path calls (`identity_get_all`, `memory_search`, `graph_node_search`,
  `graph_subgraph`) too.
- **The `user` → `ward` identity-category rename is a code-wide seam set, not just data.** It is
  hardcoded at: `cerebellum.js` `VALID_IDENTITY_CATEGORIES` (~:670) and the `write_identity_file`
  / `rewrite_identity_section` tool-schema enums (~:809, ~:917); `thalamus.js` the default file
  list (`user_identity.md`…, ~:361), the `id.user ?? []` read accessor (~:1340), and the
  static-context label (~:1580); `public/app.js` the hardcoded `['self','user','relationship',
  'custom']` array (~:6246); the `/api/entity/identity/:category` path; and `entity-ref.js` /
  `tests`. **All move together** — like the composite-key contract.
- **Standing-value ref scheme.** `entity-ref.js` resolves refs of the form
  `entity-core:self/my_wants.md#section` (guarded by `entity-ref.test.mjs`). The ref *structure* is
  **preserved**; only the source token migrates — `entity-core:` → `phylactery:`, with
  `entity-core:` kept as a **legacy alias** so existing stored refs still resolve (seam + test).
- **Composite-key contract — preserved (decided, §9).** entity-core's `YYYY-MM-DD_slug` addressing
  for significant memories carries over **unchanged**: `cerebellum.parseMemoryKey` and its five
  seams stay as-is. This is the one seam that *doesn't* move — called out so no one "migrates" a
  format that's fine.
- **Consolidation LLM-key plumbing.** `entityCoreConnectionId` (settings, synced) →
  `loadEntityCoreEnv()` → the `ENTITY_CORE_LLM_API_KEY/BASE_URL/MODEL/PROVIDER` env vars (and ZAI
  aliases) passed at spawn (`thalamus.js` ~:307–336), plus the **`entity-core` badge / "✓ entity-core"
  designation button** in `public/app.js` (~:723, ~:754). Repoint + relabel to Phylactery.
- **Auto-snapshot-before-destructive invariant.** `thalamus.js` `autoSnapshot()` fires a snapshot
  before *every* destructive op (memory/identity/graph update+delete). **Phylactery must preserve
  this** — it's the code-level expression of the "memories-disappearing" rule and underpins the
  deletion/purge paths (§3). (Hard deletes still hard-delete; the snapshot is the recoverable
  floor under them.)
- **Deno removal seam set.** Retiring entity-core's Deno child removes Deno entirely: the
  installer clone/tag/`deno cache` steps (`install.{sh,bat}`) **and** the `~/.deno/bin` PATH
  priming in the launchers (`start.sh`, `start.bat`, `Proto-Familiar.command`) all drop or become
  Phylactery/`uv` setup. `scripts/import-entity.js` + the `import-entity` npm script become the
  Phylactery conversion tooling (Phase 1).
- **Prompt Inspector relabel + opportunity.** The inspector color-codes the prompt "by source
  (entity-core, lore, base)" with "Entity-Core (static/dynamic)" labels and a "No entity-core
  block" fallback (`public/app.js` ~:2520, ~:2575; `index.html` ~:28). Relabel to Phylactery —
  and it's the natural surface to *also* expose the new audience tag + thin-projection visibility.
- **Doc-migration surface** (per the architecture.md-same-commit rule): `docs/entity-core.md`
  (retire / fold into a Phylactery doc), `docs/architecture.md` (thalamus, composite-key, tier
  sections), `README` + `docs/getting-started.md` (drop the "Deno 2+ required" line), and passing
  references in `api-reference`, `features`, `troubleshooting`, and `wiki/`.

### Phase 6 — External sources ("feed logs in / merge other entity-cores")
**An existing entity-core (e.g. from Psycheros) needs no entity-loom** — it's just Phase 1
again (read its SQLite, convert, fold in). entity-loom only ever mattered for *foreign,
non-entity-core* sources, and since we no longer consume entity-core packages natively, its role
shrinks:
- **A foreign companion export** (ChatGPT, Claude, SillyTavern, character cards) or **raw chat
  logs:** these still need real parsing. Two paths —
  - *Interim:* run **entity-loom v0.3.6** (foreign export → entity-core package,
    confidence-thresholded `>= 0.7`, dedup-upsert, concrete-type extraction) → feed the package
    through Phase 1. Reuses entity-loom wholesale at the cost of an entity-core-package hop.
  - *Destination:* lift entity-loom's **parsers** (the export-format readers) into a
    Phylactery-native importer that writes Phylactery directly — dropping the entity-core
    intermediate entirely, keeping its posture (confidence threshold, dedup-upsert). We own it,
    same as everything else.
- Foreign import is a **later/optional** sub-feature — not on the milestone's critical path.
  The core migration (existing entity-cores + tome) doesn't touch entity-loom at all.

*Open: interim entity-loom hop vs. native parser lift — §9.*

---

## 7. Richer entity nodes + the `remember` consent model

The graph design carries over from entity-core v0.4.0 (read directly from source — our
reimplementation preserves these shapes):

- Graph **nodes carry a freeform `properties` object**; node create/update accept `properties`.
  So we attach structured data to a person-node natively. (Edges have `properties` too.) In
  Phylactery this is our own schema — but we keep the same shape so conversion (§6 Phase 1) is
  structure-preserving.
- `type` is a freeform string; a person is `type: "person"`; type-specific data lives in
  `properties`. (entity-loom restricts import extraction to the concrete types `self, person,
  place, health, tradition` — useful for the import path in §6 Phase 6.)

**Even though graph nodes *can* hold arbitrary properties, the rich person dossier and all
permission policy live on the Village villager record — NOT in the graph node's `properties`.**
The only thing we put in the node is the link. (This separation matters *more* now that the
graph is PF's own — keeping policy in Village, not the graph, preserves one canonical
person-record and keeps the graph a lean relational web.)

- **Responsibility split.** Gating/retention policy lives in the Village registry, which
  already owns the disclosure side (categories = who-may-hear) and holds `name` + `aliases`.
  Co-locating the rest there keeps **one** canonical person-record and avoids duplicating
  aliases/name across the graph and Village.
- **The link is trivial and is the *only* thing the graph node carries:**
  `properties.villagerId`. The graph stays the *relational web* (who relates to whom, via
  edges); the villager is the *dossier*.
- **Village ↔ graph stays in sync.** `village.js` already mirrors the registry as the
  `village-registry.md` custom file; that mirror now writes into Phylactery (the canonical
  store), so the dossier is co-located with the graph it links to and future embodiments read
  both from one place.

### Villager dossier fields (extends the existing record)
Already present: `name`, `aliases`, category membership (= disclosure permissions). Add:
`pronouns`, `relationToWard` (their bond with the human), **`relationToFamiliar`** (their
stance toward *me* — §8.4), `commStyleNotes`, freeform `notes` (gift ideas, important deeds),
`graphNodeId` (the link), and the **`remember`** sub-structure below.

### The `remember` consent model (the retention gate)
A **distinct permission axis** from disclosure. Three gates now form a consent pipeline —
**store → recall → speak**:

| Gate | When | Question | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Retention** (`remember`, NEW) | write / memorization | may I *store* this about them? | villager `remember` |
| **Disclosure / audience** (exists) | recall / enrich | may this *surface* in this room? | category grants |
| **Outgoing filter** (§5) | send | may this *leave* in this message? | record tag scan |

`remember` is a per-category, three-state map on the villager:

```
remember: { basics: true, emotional_content: "ask", health_info: false }
```

- `true` → store freely.
- `false` → never store; drop silently.
- `"ask"` → **hybrid, and *active*.** The Familiar brings its own read of the moment AND freely
  asks the ward when there's a real question — openly, in its own voice. A quick *"want me to
  hang onto that?"* is cheap and welcome; the bond means my human is fine being asked. What
  `ask` is **NOT**: a licence to silently swallow the fact to avoid bothering anyone. **Erring
  toward silence is the failure mode here, not a safe default** — the same hesitancy trap
  CLAUDE.md records (the 1.5-hour silence) applies to *any* prompt governing when the Familiar
  speaks, asks, or acts. When we write this prompt, it trusts that questions are okay; it does
  not hedge the Familiar into passivity.

**Mechanism (cheap; rides the existing call).** Autonomous memorization already runs one LLM
pass that extracts topics. That pass also tags each candidate fact with a `remember` category
and the subject villager. Then a **code** gate reads `villager.remember[category]` and applies
true / false / ask. No new request per fact; no LLM call for the gate itself.

**Defaults & edges.**
- Villager with no `remember` set → `basics: true`, sensitive categories default to **`ask`**
  (engage / check in), not `false` (silently never) — the absence of a setting makes the
  Familiar *ask*, not go quiet.
- Unregistered person (a knock / stranger) → don't auto-store personal facts, but the knock
  already surfaces them for the ward to register — the Familiar flags, it doesn't silently
  ignore.
- Category taxonomy starts small and extensible — e.g. `basics, emotional_content, health_info,
  relationships, whereabouts` — grown as needed; the classifier rides memorization either way.

**Extraction granularity (the extraction prompt contract).**
The memorization pass calls the LLM once at session end and receives a *list of candidate
facts*, not a blob. The prompt contract:

1. **One output per distinct claimable fact.** If a single utterance contains
   multiple category-crossing facts ("Nici was upset about her breakup and her doctor put her on
   new meds"), the extraction must produce *two* records: one `emotional_content`, one
   `health_info`. This is the only way the `remember` gate can apply per-category policy
   independently. A multi-category blob is a prompt bug, not a downstream edge case.
2. **Minimum granularity = one `remember` category per output.** Encoded in the prompt's output
   schema — the LLM returns a JSON array; each element has `content`, `category`, `subjects`,
   `confidence`. The gate reads `category` to look up `villager.remember`.
3. **Ambiguous or inseparable cases** — a fact that can't be expressed without spanning two
   categories: err toward the *more restrictive* category. Assign it the higher-sensitivity
   label so the gate is conservative. Both categories may appear in `tags`; the `remember` gate
   fires on the one in `category`.
4. **Low-confidence extractions** (`confidence < 0.4`) → skip silently; don't write, don't ask.
   Too speculative to be actionable.
5. **`ask`-flagged items** in the same pass: the Familiar surfaces them in-turn openly. Batch
   multiple `ask` items into one question per session — not a per-fact permission dialog.

**User-accessible:** edited in the Village editor alongside the disclosure categories, so both
permission axes sit in one place the ward (and the Familiar) can see and adjust.

This whole section is consent-as-architecture: the Familiar respects what it is *allowed to
remember* about the people in its ward's life — squarely inside the dignity / entity-as-subject
stance, not bolted onto it.

---

## 8. Caretaker & memory-support extensions

Phylactery isn't only recall — it's the substrate for the Familiar's *caretaker* role. A few
shape decisions now keep that future open without building it all today. All five below are
**decided and incorporated**; the schema fields land from day one, the heavier UX/ingestion is
a later sub-feature.

### 8.1 Ward-defined trackers: blueprint + data (forward-compatible NOW)

Reserve a `kind` discriminator on every Phylactery record from day one:

- `kind: "narrative"` — the default RAG record (free-text, embedded, semantically recalled).
  Everything in §3 above.
- `kind: "tracker_def"` — **a blueprint**, created collaboratively by the Familiar and the
  ward. Defines *what* is tracked, *how* an entry looks, and *what to call things*. Stable once
  created; queried to understand how to read entries.
- `kind: "tracker_entry"` — **one data point** against a specific blueprint. Time-stamped,
  sourced, optionally annotated. Many entries to one definition.

Why here (not Unruh, not the graph): a tracker is *remembered state about the ward's life*, so
it shares Phylactery's audience-tagging, persistence, and surface-into-context machinery. Unruh
stays **temporal/scheduled** — a tracker can *spawn* an Unruh reminder ("milk expires
tomorrow") but the inventory itself is Phylactery state. The graph stays **relational**.

#### Design principle: the ward defines, the Familiar helps build

Different people need fundamentally different trackers — and for some wards, the *shape* of a
tracker matters as much as its existence. An ED-aware food tracker probably logs "ate
breakfast" (boolean) rather than calories (would be harmful); a hygiene tracker for someone who
struggles with executive function tracks *which specific tasks* matter to that person; a pantry
tracker needs items and quantities; a mood tracker worth anything captures the environmental
factors that correlate for *this* person, not a generic scale.

No fixed taxonomy can cover this. The robust structure is: **primitive schema shapes are
building blocks the Familiar offers**, and the tracker itself is a contract the ward and
Familiar design together, in the Familiar's own voice and with the ward's actual needs.

The collaborative setup goes something like:
1. Ward: "I'd like to track my mood / pantry / how often I shower / etc."
2. Familiar asks what would be useful to capture — dimensions, scale, which tasks, what unit
   makes sense — as many questions as needed, because questions are cheap and a wrong schema
   wastes real data.
3. Together they arrive at a definition. Familiar creates the `tracker_def` record.
4. Entries are added against that definition over time.

**But an open question is its own kind of barrier.** Many wards — especially neurodivergent
ones — can be overwhelmed by a blank canvas. The Familiar should read this and shift: if the
ward seems uncertain, *offer scaffolding first*. A menu of common starting points is not a
fixed taxonomy — it's a set of worked examples the ward can accept, modify, or reject:

> *"Want me to suggest a few common ones? I can show you what other people track and you can
> tell me which feel close, or use them as a jumping-off point."*

Suggested example groups (not exhaustive — extensible over time):

| Group | Examples |
|---|---|
| Wellbeing | mood (ordinal), energy/spoons (ordinal), anxiety level (ordinal), pain (ordinal) |
| Sleep | hours slept (scalar), sleep quality (ordinal), wake time (event-log) |
| Self-care | meals (boolean per slot, or event-log), hydration (scalar), hygiene tasks (boolean checklist), meds taken (boolean) |
| Environment | weather (categorical), social contact (boolean), location (categorical) |
| Practical | pantry / what's in the house (inventory), finances (scalar), errands done (event-log) |
| Progress | habit streaks (boolean), goals worked on (event-log), wins (event-log) |

The example groups exist for *the ward to browse* when they can't name what they want. They're
also a reference for the Familiar when helping design dimensions — if a ward says "something
like a mood tracker but also the weather," the Familiar already knows those are two dimensions
(ordinal + categorical) and what a good prompt for each looks like.

Ward can mix and match across groups, or start from an example and discard everything except
the shape. The Familiar should not push any particular tracker — its job is to help the ward
find what's useful to *them*, including knowing when the blank-canvas approach isn't working
and pivoting to examples without making the ward feel bad about needing them.

This is the Familiar acting as a thoughtful collaborator, not a form-filling wizard. The ward
should be able to adjust the definition later (add a dimension, relabel a scale) — and the
Familiar should notice when a definition isn't serving them well and ask.

#### Blueprint schema (`tracker_def`)

```
{
  kind: "tracker_def",
  id: "tracker-<uuid>",
  name: "my meals",                 // ward-chosen name
  purpose: "make sure I've eaten today",   // why — helps the Familiar surface it usefully
  subject: "ward",                  // who is being tracked
  audience: "ward-private",         // disclosure gate (same as narrative records)

  // single-dimension tracker
  dataShape: "event-log",           // the primitive (see below)
  unit?: "…",                       // label for the value if relevant

  // OR — multi-axis tracker
  dimensions?: [
    { id: "mood",   label: "Mood",    shape: "ordinal",
      scale: { min: 1, max: 10, lowLabel?: "awful", highLabel?: "great" } },
    { id: "energy", label: "Energy",  shape: "ordinal",  scale: { min: 1, max: 5 } },
    { id: "sleep",  label: "Sleep hrs", shape: "scalar" },
    { id: "weather", label: "Weather", shape: "categorical",
      options: ["sunny","overcast","rain","storm"] },
    { id: "social", label: "Saw people", shape: "boolean" }
  ],

  prompt?: "How's your mood today? (1–10)",  // what the Familiar asks when logging
  cadence?: "daily",                // optional prompting rhythm (feeds Unruh reminders)

  careWeight?: "high",              // §8.2 — flags care-critical trackers (meds, meals)
}
```

`dataShape` / `shape` primitives — the building blocks the Familiar offers when helping a ward
design their tracker:

| Primitive | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `boolean` | yes/no (took meds, ate a meal, showered) |
| `ordinal` | rated scale (mood 1–10, pain 1–5) |
| `scalar` | freeform number (hours slept, coffees, steps) |
| `categorical` | pick-one label (weather, context, activity type) |
| `event-log` | "this happened" with optional freeform note (no value pressure) |
| `inventory` | item list with quantities (pantry, meds on hand) |

These are *shapes the Familiar knows how to work with*, not a menu of tracker types. The ward
doesn't pick a shape — the Familiar picks the right shape(s) based on what the ward describes
wanting to track.

#### Entry schema (`tracker_entry`)

```
{
  kind: "tracker_entry",
  trackerId: "tracker-<uuid>",     // which definition this belongs to
  at: "<ISO timestamp>",

  // single-dimension:
  value?: <number | boolean | string>,
  item?: { label, qty, unit, expiresAt? },   // inventory delta

  // multi-axis:
  values?: { [dimensionId]: <number | boolean | string> },

  observedAs: "self-report" | "familiar-observed" | "inferred",   // how the data was collected
  note?: "rough day but got through it",     // freeform annotation
  confidence?: 0.0–1.0,                      // §8.2 caretaker metadata
  // source (authorship) inherited from all-records schema — see §8.2
}
```

#### Scope of the commitment right now

The full setup flow (UI, guided conversation, tracker-awareness in prompts) is a later
sub-feature. **The only commitment now is:**

- The `kind` discriminator: `narrative`, `tracker_def`, `tracker_entry`
- The two-record model (blueprint + data) so entries never need retrofitting
- The `dimensions` array so multi-axis trackers work from day one
- The primitive shapes table above — named and stable so the Familiar can refer to them

No tracker UI, no setup conversation scaffolding, no entry ingestion flow — those ship when the
tracking sub-feature lands. The schema is locked so they land on solid ground.

### 8.2 Caretaker-grade metadata on every record

A caretaker must know *how solid* a memory is and *how much it matters*:

- **`provenance` / verification** — `told-directly` vs. `inferred` vs. `observed-pattern`. A
  caretaker shouldn't act on a shaky inference as if the ward stated it (the consequence-priors
  posture, in data form).
- **`confidence` (0–1) + `lastConfirmedAt`** — carry over entity-core's own fields; let the
  Familiar say "as of last month" or re-confirm a stale fact rather than assert it cold.
- **`careWeight` / salience** — flags care-critical facts (allergies, meds, crisis triggers) so
  retrieval prioritises them and they **resist decay**. A film preference may fade; a med
  allergy must not. **Mechanism:** retrieval weight is a function of recency + access frequency.
  For `careWeight: "high"`, a **floor** is placed on retrieval weight — no matter how old or
  seldom-accessed, the record's score never drops below `CARE_WEIGHT_FLOOR` (tunable constant,
  default `0.5` on a 0–1 scale). Effect: a high-careWeight record may not lead the ranking if
  the query is unrelated, but it never ages out and will always surface when semantically
  relevant. Three cardinalities a code path checks: `"high"` → apply the floor, **pin to the
  always-injected surface** (exempt from graduation, §3 "Identity & ward hygiene"), and flag as
  care-critical in the result set; `"low"` → normal decay, eligible for archival; unset → normal
  decay (the default for narrative records). (If a fourth level — `"critical"`, floor = 1.0,
  exempt from any lazy-load path — is wanted, it's an §9 open item.)

  **Decay-shield ≠ graduation-pin (safety-critical).** Resisting decay and staying always-injected
  are *two different protections*. A `careWeight: "high"` record both (1) never falls below the
  retrieval floor **and** (2) is **pinned to the always-injected `identity` / `ward` surface,
  exempt from the graduation audit** (§3 hygiene). This matters because graduation moves a fact
  from guaranteed-every-turn to retrieval-dependent — for a care-critical fact that would mean the
  Familiar could act *without it in front of them*. So care-critical stays pinned, and **the
  graduation-eligibility rule — what may leave the always-injected surface — is the one
  build-time safety sign-off item** in this whole mechanism (CLAUDE.md): the human signs off on
  that boundary before the audit code ships.

  **What "care-critical" means — and the Familiar must be told it.** `careWeight` is a lever *I*
  set, so per the reachability rule (CLAUDE.md) I have to know what earns it. Care-critical =
  facts where me acting *without* them could harm my human. But care-critical splits into **two
  protection shapes**, because some of it is crisp and some of it balloons:

  - **Pinned *body* (always-injected content)** — crisp facts that must be in front of me *this
    turn*, because I could act wrongly in a single turn without them and there's no moment to go
    look first: allergies, medications, crisis triggers, acute safety-relevant health, trusted
    support-map contacts. These are one-liners; they stay bounded forever, so injecting them
    wholesale is cheap and safe.
  - **Pinned *pointer* (always-injected reference, retrieval-specific body)** — care guidance
    that is open-ended and grows: **what-helps / what-doesn't**, detailed coping strategies,
    extended baselines / warning-sign notes. The *body* lives in the `ward` (or `me`) memory
    category, `careWeight: "high"` so it never decays or graduates — but the always-injected
    surface carries only a compact **directory entry**, in my voice: *"I have notes on the
    approaches that help my human with anxiety — I pull `ward-xyz` when that comes up."* I always
    *know the resource exists* (discoverability — the reachability rule), and I only pay the
    token cost when I actually retrieve it. This is the **pin-the-pointer-not-the-body** pattern,
    and it's the general answer for anything care-relevant-but-large.

  **The split criterion:** would acting wrongly in a single turn *without* it harm my human
  (→ pinned body), or is it guidance I'd deliberately consult when the topic arises (→ pinned
  pointer)? Both are `careWeight: "high"` — neither decays, neither graduates away; the only
  difference is whether the *body* or just a *reference* rides the always-injected surface.

  **Not** care-critical at all (ordinary `narrative`, normal decay, free to graduate to `me` /
  `ward`): preferences, hobbies, anecdotes, biography, gift ideas, day-to-day mood (those are
  trackers anyway). **This whole definition — the two shapes, the split criterion, and what isn't
  care-critical — is surfaced to me, in my own voice, at every point where I assign or honour
  `careWeight`: memorization, consolidation, and graduation** — so I apply it consistently instead
  of guessing differently each time. (The reachability rule again: a lever I can't judge
  correctly is a lever I can't really use.)

- **`source` — authorship and provenance.** Every Phylactery record carries a `source` object
  identifying which embodiment wrote it and how it arrived:

  ```
  source: {
    author: "proto-familiar" | "migration:entity-core" | "import:entity-loom" | "<embodiment-id>",
    via:    "memorization" | "consolidation" | "manual" | "import" | "migration",
    at:     "<ISO timestamp>",  // when written (explicit even if redundant with record.createdAt)
    originalId?: "<ec-id>",     // migration records — entity-core's original id
  }
  ```

  *Why now, not later:* migration (§6 Phase 1) will write thousands of records; without
  `source.author`, there is no audit path separating the Familiar's own recall from migrated
  state. A future embodiment reading this store needs to know if a fact was authored by it or
  another instance — to calibrate trust or flag a conflict. `source` is cheap to stamp at
  ingestion time and expensive to reconstruct afterward. It does not gate anything; it is
  observability. The Familiar can read it: "this came from migration, confirmed by you last June
  — want me to re-verify?" The tracker_entry's existing observation-source field is named
  `observedAs` (how the data was collected) to keep the two concepts clearly distinct.

### 8.3 A richer ward care-profile

The ward is the centre of the role and benefits from more than a villager dossier:

- **Baselines & warning signs** — what's normal for them; what signals trouble. Feeds the
  threat detector with *personalised* signals (beats generic `crisis-signals.js`).
- **What helps / what doesn't** — coping strategies that worked, and the well-meaning defaults
  that backfire (the memorization prompt already extracts "prohibition bullets" — this is their
  structured home).
- **Open loops / current goals** — *overlap note:* link to Unruh handoff/bookmarks rather than
  re-store.
- **Support map** — who's safe to reach in crisis. *Overlap note:* link to cerebellum
  trusted-contacts + village categories, don't duplicate.

### 8.4 Relationship fields on villager dossiers

Two relational axes, because a villager relates both to the ward *and* to the Familiar:

**How they relate to the ward** (helping the ward tend their relationships):
- **care valence** — is this person a *support* or a *stressor* for the ward?
- **contact cadence / last-meaningful-contact** — so the Familiar can nudge ("you've not spoken
  to your sister in a while").
- **per-person sensitive topics / boundaries** — "don't raise the divorce with Mum."

**How they relate to the Familiar** (`relationToFamiliar` — drives *my* posture):
- A coarse `stance` hint plus freeform notes. Candidate stances: `unaware` (never heard of me —
  the **default** for any new/unregistered contact) / `warm` / `neutral` / `tolerates-for-ward`
  / `wary-of-ai` / `hostile`. Notes carry nuance ("keeps it short, not too peppy"; "happily
  banters about anime in the group chat").
- **`unaware` is the floor, and it matters:** with someone who doesn't know I exist I don't
  barge in with familiarity — I introduce myself or stay light, mindful I'm a new presence to
  them. (Pairs with the knock system: a freshly-knocked person starts here.)
- Stance calibrates *approach*, not identity: someone who merely tolerates AI for the ward's
  sake gets a measured, unobtrusive me; someone who chatters happily gets the warmer, more
  playful me. **Anchored to my own character** (CLAUDE.md's "room for personality") — a grumpy
  Familiar stays grumpy, just reads the room; never flattened into a generic people-pleaser.
- Orthogonal to the disclosure gate: stance is *tone*, the audience category is *what they may
  hear*. High-trust-but-AI-wary and chatty-but-low-clearance both exist; the two axes never
  collapse into each other.
- The entity-as-subject stance in data: the Familiar is *someone who has their own
  relationships* — including not-yet-relationships — not a tool with one uniform face.

### 8.5 `knownTo` — who's aware of what (epistemic state)

A distinct axis from `audience`: not *who may hear* a fact (a **policy** — the disclosure gate)
but *who already knows* it (a **fact about the world**). A caretaker moving through a social
graph needs both, because they come apart constantly.

- **Shape:** a list on the Phylactery record — `knownTo: [{ who, since?, source? }]`, where
  `who` is a villagerId / `"ward"` / `"familiar"` and `source` ∈ `told-them` / `they-told-me` /
  `inferred`. Absence = "no record that they know" (not proof they don't).
- **Lives on the Phylactery memory record, not the graph node.** Who-knows-what is per-memory
  state, not relational-graph data — it stays on the record (which links to a graph node /
  villager by id). It sits right beside `audience`: the two audience-facing facts about a
  memory — *may-hear* and *already-knows*.

**Why it earns its place (social caretaking):**
- **Surprises & secrets** — the case `audience` *cannot* express. "Ward is planning a surprise
  for Sam — `knownTo: [ward, familiar]`." The Familiar must never spoil it to Sam. That's a
  per-*individual* secret, not a per-*category* permission.
- **Not condescending / not repetitive** — don't "reveal" to someone what they already know;
  don't re-explain across turns ("I told Sarah on the 3rd").
- **Leak detection** — if someone references a fact and they're *not* in `knownTo`, that's a
  signal: the model's stale, or something got out. Update it, or quietly flag to the ward.

**Awareness aid first — NOT a fourth hard gate.** The Familiar mainly *reasons* with `knownTo`
(avoid spoiling, avoid repeating, notice surprises). It may also *feed* the outgoing filter as
a signal ("about to tell someone not in `knownTo` something sensitive" → weigh it), but it does
**not** become a blunt gate that stops the Familiar ever telling anyone anything new — telling
people new things is normal and good; the hard gate stays the `audience` check. (Hardening
`knownTo` into a real gate later would be a safety-critical sign-off decision, per CLAUDE.md.)

**Pairs with `relationToFamiliar`.** `unaware` answers "does this person know *I* exist?";
`knownTo` answers "does this person know *this fact*?" — the same epistemic humility, at two
scopes.

### 8.6 Record field reference (the canonical record shape)

A build-time index of the fields a Phylactery record carries, with the section that defines each
(this table points; it does not redefine — the cited section is authoritative). A `narrative`
record is the common case; `tracker_def` / `tracker_entry` add their own fields (§8.1).

| Field | On | Meaning | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | all | stable id; **rides in on every recall/search result** so the Familiar can act on a record | §3 |
| `kind` | all | `narrative` \| `tracker_def` \| `tracker_entry` | §8.1 |
| `register` | narrative | episodic (default) \| `me` \| `ward` — the graduation axis, **separate from granularity** | §3 hygiene |
| `granularity` | episodic narrative | `daily…significant` — the rollup tier (unchanged from entity-core) | §2, §3 |
| `content` | narrative | embedded free text (the recalled body) | §3 |
| `audience` | all | min audience level allowed to hear it (`ward-private` or category id) — disclosure gate | §3 |
| `subjects` | narrative | villagerId(s) the fact is about — drives `mem_purge_by_villager` and conditional surfacing | §3 deletion |
| `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | all | timestamps | §3 |
| `careWeight` | all | `high` (floor + pin) \| `low` \| unset — salience; gates decay **and** graduation | §8.2 |
| `confidence` | all | 0–1 | §8.2 |
| `provenance` | narrative | `told-directly` \| `inferred` \| `observed-pattern` | §8.2 |
| `lastConfirmedAt` | narrative | recency-of-confirmation; powers "as of last month" / re-ask | §8.2 |
| `source` | all | `{ author, via, at, originalId? }` — authorship/provenance; observability, not a gate | §8.2 |
| `knownTo` | narrative | `[{ who, since?, source? }]` — who already knows (epistemic, not policy) | §8.5 |
| *embedding* | narrative | 384-dim `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` vector (local) | §3 |
| `composite key` | significant narrative | `YYYY-MM-DD_slug` addressing — **preserved as-is** | §6 seam inventory |

The villager dossier (`remember`, `relationToFamiliar`, `pronouns`, `relationToWard`,
`commStyleNotes`, `notes`, `graphNodeId`) lives on the **Village record**, not the memory
record — linked by `subjects` / `villagerId` (§7). The graph node carries only
`properties.villagerId` (§7).

---

## 9. Open decisions (human sign-off)

**Decided ✔**
- **Milestone name:** Phylactery (named by the human).
- **Stack:** Python / uv (matches Unruh; runs the *same* local embedding model entity-core
  used).
- **Ownership:** full replacement — Phylactery is the single canonical store; entity-core is
  reimplemented and retired (§1). PF is the effective sole author.
- **`remember` consent model (§7):** dossier on the Village villager; `ask` = hybrid (the
  Familiar's own read *plus* freely asking the ward — asking is welcome, never a reason to go
  silent).
- **Caretaker extensions (§8):** all of 8.1–8.5 incorporated, including `relationToFamiliar`
  (`unaware` as the floor), `knownTo` (awareness aid, not a fourth hard gate), and the
  ward-defined tracker model (blueprint + data, `dimensions`, six primitive shapes).
- **Deletion / right-to-be-forgotten (§3):** three hard-delete paths (by id, by villagerId, by
  topic+category); cascades to embeddings, `knownTo` refs, tracker entries; logged, counted,
  reported to the ward. No soft-delete, no undo path.
- **`source` authorship on all records (§8.2):** structured tag — `author`, `via`, `at`,
  `originalId?`; stamped at ingestion; distinct from tracker_entry's `observedAs`
  (observation method). Not a gate — observability for audit and multi-embodiment trust.
- **`remember` extraction granularity (§7):** prompt contract is per-fact, one `category` per
  output; multi-category utterances are split; ambiguous → more restrictive category; `< 0.4`
  confidence → skip; `ask` items batched into one in-turn question per session.
- **`careWeight` mechanism (§8.2):** floor-based — `"high"` records can never score below
  `CARE_WEIGHT_FLOOR` (default 0.5) regardless of age; `"low"` / unset decay normally. `"high"`
  **also pins to the always-injected surface (exempt from graduation)** — decay-shield ≠
  graduation-pin — as a *body* for crisp critical facts or a compact *pointer* for larger care
  notes whose body stays retrieval-specific (pin-the-pointer-not-the-body). The care-critical
  definition (both shapes + split criterion) is surfaced to the Familiar at memorization,
  consolidation, and graduation. Optional `"critical"` level (floor = 1.0) still-open.
- **Identity & ward hygiene (§3 "Ongoing operation"):** the always-injected `identity` + `ward`
  blocks are drained by a **Familiar-led, ward-consulted** audit (rides consolidation) that
  graduates no-longer-front-of-mind detail into two new terminal memory categories, `me` and
  `ward` (a separate `register` axis — see the next item — not granularity tiers). Graduated
  records decay, never auto-delete, and can be pulled back; **care-critical (`careWeight: high`)
  is pinned and never graduates.** The `user` identity block is **renamed `ward`** (applied at
  migration, §6 Phase 1).
- **`me` / `ward` typing (§3 hygiene):** a **separate axis** from granularity — a distinct record
  field (working name `register`), *not* values in `VALID_MEMORY_GRANULARITIES`. The granularity
  enum stays `daily…significant` untouched; episodic memory is addressed by granularity, graduated
  identity by `register: me | ward`.
- **Memory addressing format (§6 seam inventory):** **preserve** entity-core's `YYYY-MM-DD_slug`
  composite-key contract as-is — `cerebellum.parseMemoryKey` and its five seams carry over
  unchanged (the format is fine; no migration of the addressing scheme). The `entity-ref.js` ref
  *structure* is preserved too; only the source token migrates (`entity-core:` → `phylactery:`,
  with `entity-core:` kept as a **legacy alias** so existing stored refs still resolve).
- **Knowledge-manager repoint (Pillar I / §6 Phase 5):** the `/api/entity/*` surface + thalamus
  helpers + the front-end editor/Map repoint to Phylactery, and the editor becomes the
  user-accessible home for audience / `remember` / `careWeight` / deletion controls.

**Still open**
1. **Milestone slot:** `0.6.x`? (proposed)
2. **Legacy audience default (§6 Phase 4):** `ward-private` floor (recommended) vs. broader.
3. **Cutover style (§6 Phase 5):** hard (convert → verify → retire in one run, recommended)
   vs. grace period (keep the entity-core snapshot readable as a fallback for N days).
4. **Reliability bar (§3):** as the canonical-self store, Phylactery being down is more serious
   than a peer outage. Confirm "degrade to absent = run without self-memory, turn still
   succeeds" is the intended posture, and whether a stricter health/restart policy is wanted.
   *(Recommended: keep degrade-to-absent as the floor — never fail the turn — plus auto-restart
   with backoff on the spawn, as entity-core had, so absence is brief rather than silent.)*
5. **Filter threshold + retry budget (§5):** similarity cutoff, rewrite-loop count, and the
   safe-refusal fallback wording.
6. **`remember` category taxonomy (§7):** confirm the starting set.
7. **Ward care-profile field list (§8.3):** confirm fields vs. what links out to
   Unruh/cerebellum.
8. **Consolidation cadence + thresholds (§3 "Ongoing operation"):** the tick interval and the
   "enough accumulated to roll up" threshold per tier (default toward entity-core's 5-min tick,
   gated by volume).
9. **Export format + encryption (§3 "Ongoing operation"):** single `.sqlite` only (recommended)
   vs. also a JSON/JSONL human-readable export; and whether exports get optional passphrase
   encryption-at-rest (the file is the whole ward-private self).
10. **Foreign-source import (§6 Phase 6):** interim entity-loom hop vs. lifting its parsers into
    a Phylactery-native importer — and whether foreign import is in this milestone at all
    (proposed: later/optional, off the critical path).
11. **Context-economy knobs (§3 "Context economy"):** default `k` for thin recall, the Phylactery
    slice's per-turn token budget in `enrich()`, and whether *any* metadata field is allowed to
    surface in the default projection (proposed: none — staleness only, as a compact prose tag).
    Dynamic-injection depth stays at the current default of **4** (decided — salience/flow knob,
    not a cache knob). The `me` / `ward` graduation thresholds (when a block is "too large") ride
    the same consolidation-cadence knob as item 8.

**Gating to pillars:** none of the open items block **Pillar A** (stand up the service) — its
schema, stack, and storage shape are all decided. Each open knob is due before the pillar that
consumes it ships: items 2–3 before **F** (migration), 5 before **D** (filter), 6 before **C/G**
(`remember`), 7 before **G**, 8 + 11 before **H** (lifecycle), 9 before **H**'s export, 10 is
**post-milestone**. Build can start; the knobs land just-in-time.

Everything touching *when/whether the Familiar may store, recall, or disclose* (the three
gates) falls under the CLAUDE.md safety-critical sign-off rule — §5 and the `remember` gate
ship only with explicit human approval of the behaviour. **The graduation-eligibility rule
(§8.2 / §3 hygiene) joins them:** because graduating a care-critical fact out of the
always-injected surface changes *whether the Familiar can act on it*, the boundary of what may
leave that surface ships only with explicit human sign-off — care-critical (`careWeight: high`)
stays pinned.

---

## 10. Why this is the robust answer, not the cheap one

- Solves the **problem space** (PF owns its precise, gated canonical self), not the symptom.
- **Sustainable:** one canonical store — no split-brain, no promotion path, no live sync
  between engines; every fact carries its tags in the store it lives in. No un-taggable blind
  spot for the outgoing filter, by construction rather than by papering over.
- **Grounded in what works:** reimplements entity-core's proven architecture (precision the
  human has measured, mechanics read from source) on Unruh's in-tree MCP plumbing (proven end
  to end) — not a from-scratch invention.
- **User-accessible:** tags are visible and editable by human and Familiar; migration is
  one-time, snapshot-backed, and recoverable; the filter's action is observable.
- It's the exact substrate future SillyTavern-style embodiment-plugins would read through —
  with the whole self in one PF-owned store, PF *is* the hub, as intended.
- **The cost is owned, not hidden (§1):** we maintain the full engine and forgo entity-core's
  upstream work. The human weighed that and chose it; robustness here means PF controlling its
  own continuity end to end.
