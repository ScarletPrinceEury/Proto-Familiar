## Chat Interface

### Sending Messages
Type in the input bar and press **Enter** (or **Send**). Hold **Shift+Enter** for a newline.

### Streaming
Server-sent event (SSE) streaming is enabled by default. Toggle it off in **Settings → Streaming** to receive the full response at once instead.

### Regenerate
Re-run the last AI response with the same user message using the **↺ Regenerate** button that appears on the last assistant message.

### Export
Download the current conversation as a Markdown `.md` file via **☰ → Export**. Tool-call turns are omitted from the export.

### Message Timestamps
Every message is stamped with a time label:
- Same day: `HH:MM`
- Earlier: `Mon DD HH:MM`

### Dark / Light Theme
Toggle between dark and light themes using the theme button in the top bar.
