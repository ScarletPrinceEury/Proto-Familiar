/**
 * session-search.js — search the RAW conversation transcript (not memory).
 *
 * The companion to `recall` (which searches Phylactery's distilled memories):
 * this reads the actual session logs, so the Familiar can find what was literally
 * SAID — an outcome my human mentioned in passing that was never memorised yet.
 * The motivating case is the noticing loop closing an overdue projection: "did my
 * human already tell me how the appointment went?" The answer ("wasn't as scary")
 * often carries none of the event's keywords, so this supports TWO ways in:
 *   - a text query (words we'd likely have used), and
 *   - a time window (`sinceMs`) that returns everything said since then, keyword-
 *     free — the reliable way to read back over "since this morning".
 *
 * Scope: this only ever RUNS on a private ward turn (the `search_conversation`
 * executor fail-closes on a gated villager turn), so its results never reach a
 * villager regardless of what it read. That means it can safely read the ward's
 * own chats (web + ward DM), private voice, AND the GROUP rooms the ward shares —
 * an outcome my human mentioned to friends is fair game for closing a loop. The
 * one line held back is a villager's 1:1 DM: that channel is private to THAT
 * villager (the content-gating boundary), not the ward's to sweep — `isWardReadableLog`
 * excludes it unless `includeVillagerDms` is set.
