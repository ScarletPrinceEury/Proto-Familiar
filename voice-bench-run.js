/**
 * The ward-facing benchmark run manager (voice spec §0.5).
 *
 * A benchmark takes minutes, not milliseconds — models load, audio decodes,
 * the interference phase samples repeatedly. So the HTTP surface is
 * start/poll/cancel rather than one long request that a proxy or a closed
 * laptop lid would kill halfway.
 *
 * ── Why this is its own module ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `voice-bench.js` measures. This holds the *state of a run in progress* —
 * which stage, since when, cancelled or not — so the measuring core stays
 * pure and testable and the endpoint stays thin. Modular by default; the
 * orchestration files are for connective tissue, not for this.
 *
 * ── One run at a time, deliberately ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Two concurrent benchmarks would measure each other's contention and report
 * numbers that describe nothing real. A second start returns the run already
 * going rather than queueing or refusing — a ward who clicks twice meant to
 * run it once.
