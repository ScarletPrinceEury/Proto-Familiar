/**
 * Supervision for the audio worker child process (voice spec §2).
 *
 * The worker runs speech models; this runs the worker. Spawn, talk to it,
 * notice when it dies, restart it — and know when to stop restarting.
 *
 * ── Why a child process at all ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three reasons, spelled out in §2 because an earlier draft gave only the
 * first and it did not cover the question people actually ask:
 *   1. Native inference calls are blocking C++; in-process they would stall
 *      the server's event loop, which is the one thing that must never happen.
 *   2. The stages are largely serial anyway, so sharing a runtime with the
 *      embedder would buy nothing — and ONNX thread pools are per-process, so
 *      "sharing" would mean co-locating audio with the canonical self-store.
 *   3. Isolation buys supervision. Audio crashes restart audio, not memory.
 *
 * ── Nothing here throws at a caller ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Every request resolves, including the failures: a dead worker, a timeout, a
 * parked supervisor. Voice runs behind a ward-facing button and inside the
 * runtime's first-enable, and a rejected promise nobody caught is exactly the
 * shape of failure that reaches my human as a broken page instead of an
 * honest "I can't speak right now".
 *
 * ── Parking ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Restart-with-backoff, but bounded: three crashes inside a minute and the
 * worker is PARKED rather than restarted forever. A model that segfaults on
 * every load would otherwise spin a restart loop on a 15 W laptop until the
 * battery died — the ward would notice the fan, not the feature. Parked is a
 * reported state; chat carries on untouched.

 * Create a supervisor. Nothing spawns until the first request — a ward who

 * `workerScript` is injectable so tests can drive a stub child that speaks the
 * same protocol without a speech engine installed. Same boundary discipline as
 * the bench's `engineFactory`, for the same reason: supervision has to be
 * testable separately from the thing being supervised.
 *
 * `command` exists because the worker is not always Node. `voicebox/` is the
 * same protocol spoken by a Python process running Kyutai's own implementation
 * — the one that can hold a voice across a whole message. Supervision does not
 * care which language is on the other end of the pipe, and this is the only
