# For installs made by downloading the ZIP rather than `git clone`: the
# installer can't `git pull` those, so this fetches the latest code from
# GitHub and lays it over the current folder, then runs the installer
# for dependencies + database migrations.
#
# Your data is preserved. settings.json, logs/, saved tomes, and the
# Unruh + Phylactery databases are NOT part of the download, so copying
# the new files over the old ones can't touch them. The installer also
# auto-backs up tomes/, logs/, settings, and phylactery/data/ into
# .pf-backups/ before doing anything.
#
# If you installed with `git clone`, you don't need this — just re-run
# the installer; it does `git pull` for you.
