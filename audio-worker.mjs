/**
 * The audio worker (voice spec §2).
 *
 * A plain Node child process that owns the speech models and nothing else. It
 * speaks the framed stdio protocol in `audio-frame.js` and is supervised by
 * `audio-worker-host.js`; it knows nothing about HTTP, my human, or the rest
 * of me.
 *
 * ── It must never take anything down with it ────────────────────────────
 * Native inference is blocking C++ and this process exists to contain that.
 * So: no unhandled rejection escapes, every op answers its `reqId` even when
 * it fails, and a missing engine is reported once at load rather than thrown
 * per request. If this process dies anyway, the supervisor restarts it — and
 * that is the design, not a fallback.
 *
 * ── Thread caps come from the environment ───────────────────────────────
 * The host sets `PF_AUDIO_THREADS*`; the caps live with the supervision, not
 * buried in here. `total` is the ceiling this process holds concurrent work
 * beneath, so on a 4c/8t machine there is always a physical core's worth of
 * headroom left for Node and the Python children even mid-burst.
 *
 * ── Not yet built ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Pass 1 is the spine: load, unload, report, synthesise, and transcribe a
 * finished file. Streaming ASR, VAD gating and barge-in belong to Pass 2 and
 * are absent rather than stubbed —
 * an op that answers `unsupported` is honest; one that pretends is not.
