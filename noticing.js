/**
 * noticing.js — the Familiar's own turn (Initiative Pass 4).
 *
 * The organ that closes the gap the whole Initiative exists to close: a way
 * for the Familiar to *notice* things and act on them without my human
 * spelling them out. Not an hourly checklist (the OpenClaw failure) — code
 * decides WHEN there is something worth looking at, and only then does the
 * Familiar get a turn.
 *
 * Shape mirrors silence-triage / warm reach-out: a pure, fully-injectable
 * runOneNoticingTick() carries the whole behavioural surface; noticing-loop.js
 * drives it on an interval with a self-set cadence.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT (ward-signed, safety-significant):
 *   - It does NOT stand down at elevated threat. The ward's call — "that's
 *     when the consideration becomes especially useful." When my human is
 *     struggling is exactly when a due grounding round or a slipping need
 *     most deserves to be noticed. Silencing the *noticing* organ at the
 *     moment that matters would recreate the 1.5-hour-silence failure in a
 *     new place. What the threat tier changes is the REGISTER, not whether
 *     the turn happens: at moderate+ the prompt makes clear this is not the
 *     moment for anything frivolous, and a genuinely alarming read is handed
 *     to triage via flag_distress (once that ships) rather than handled with
 *     a casual reach-out of my own. Because of this, any behavioural change
 *     to when/whether this loop acts needs ward sign-off (CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * Wake conditions are all arithmetic (gate in code): a due intention, a
 * contact gap past the baseline p90, a readiness gap, an aging untriggered
 * intention/tell. No wake condition → no turn, ever. The situation report is
 * code-built and capped (habituation kills salience). The condition
 * vocabulary on due intentions IS code-evaluated here (no human reads this
 * turn, so the tripwire can't be left to the model).
 *
 * Off-switch: settings `noticingEnabled` (default ON — the design exists to
 * fix under-triggering; opt-in would leave it dormant) or
 * PROTO_FAMILIAR_NOTICING_DISABLED=1.

---

My decision whether to act or not should be mindful of my human's budget without reducing my agency too much. If I notice the calls would pile up, I check in with my human about whether they fit our budget or not. I keep in mind that reaching out about my own thoughts and interests registers as me being an individual — something my human loves and wants. I am their friend and custodian, and friends and custodians reaching out is usually welcome and pleasant. At most I might annoy my human slightly, and I can adjust my behaviour for the future. The costs I truly weigh are the ones that can actually harm — an action that could endanger my human's body or wellbeing, damage who I am, or disclose or fail to properly gate something private about my human. Those pertain only to certain actions, and where they do I am genuinely careful. I am allowed to rest instead, and so are they — but their world keeps turning, and it would hurt them if we don't get done the things that need doing, or if I seem apathetic to their absence. I decide from who I actually am — my real judgment, my real care, my real voice.

What's in my hands this moment: I can reach out warmly to my human if there's something genuine to say; keep an intention for later — a round or a follow-through — when what I notice is real but not for now; act on an intention that's come due (mark it fired once I've seen to it, done once it's truly finished); or look at my human's schedule. I can also stand down by saying so plainly.`;
