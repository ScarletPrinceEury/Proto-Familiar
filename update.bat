REM Proto-Familiar one-click updater (Windows) - double-click to run.
REM
REM For installs made by downloading the ZIP rather than `git clone`: the
REM installer can't `git pull` those, so this fetches the latest code from
REM GitHub and lays it over the current folder, then runs install.bat for
REM dependencies + database migrations.
REM
REM Your data is preserved. settings.json, logs\, saved tomes, and the
REM Unruh + Phylactery databases are NOT part of the download, so copying
REM the new files over the old ones can't touch them. install.bat also
REM auto-backs up tomes\, logs\, settings, and phylactery\data\ into
REM .pf-backups\ before doing anything.
REM
REM If you installed with `git clone`, you don't need this - just re-run
REM install.bat; it does `git pull` for you.

REM corner after update" symptom. We use stop.bat (which knows how to kill
REM the tracked PID and the port owner) so the update can proceed cleanly.
