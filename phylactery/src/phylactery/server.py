"""Phylactery MCP server.

Tools exposed (stable contract — Thalamus depends on these shapes):

  Liveness:
    health_check            — boot diagnostic

  Identity (always-injected, not vector-retrieved):
    identity_get_all        — return all identity files in canonical order
    identity_append         — append content to an identity file
    identity_update_section — rewrite one section of an identity file (alias)
    identity_rewrite_section — rewrite one section of an identity file

  Memory (RAG-tiered):
    memory_create           — store a new memory (appends on same-date tiers)
    memory_list             — browse memories at a tier, most-recent first
    memory_read             — full content of one memory by granularity+date
    memory_search           — semantic RAG search (falls back to recency)
    memory_search_restricted — Pillar D outgoing gate: find ward-private memories matching a draft
    memory_update           — overwrite an existing memory (auto-snapshots)
    memory_delete           — delete a memory (auto-snapshots)

  Knowledge graph (GraphRAG):
    graph_node_search       — semantic search + 1-hop GraphRAG
    graph_subgraph          — N-hop subgraph from a node
    graph_node_create       — add a new entity node
    graph_node_list         — list nodes (type-filtered, paginated)
    graph_node_update       — rename/re-describe a node (auto-snapshots)
    graph_node_delete       — delete a node + its edges (auto-snapshots)
    graph_edge_create       — record a relationship between two nodes
    graph_edge_update       — update a relationship type/weight (auto-snapshots)
    graph_edge_delete       — remove a relationship (auto-snapshots)
    graph_full              — full node+edge dump (for Map view)

  Snapshots:
    snapshot_create         — create a manual snapshot
    snapshot_list           — list available snapshots
    snapshot_restore        — restore from a snapshot

  Consolidation (A3):
    consolidate             — roll lower tiers into higher via LLM

  Lifecycle (Pillar H):
    lifecycle_pass          — hygiene + consolidation + graduation audit on demand
    graduation_list_pending — ward-block detail graduated but not yet mentioned
    graduation_acknowledge  — mark graduation mentions as surfaced
    backup_export           — passphrase-encrypted single-file backup
    backup_restore          — restore from a passphrase-encrypted backup

  Ward consent (Pillar I):
    remember_map_get        — read the ward's remember consent map
    remember_map_set        — write the ward's remember consent map
