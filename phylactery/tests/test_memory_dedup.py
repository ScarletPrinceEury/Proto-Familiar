"""Semantic dedup-merge at memory write time.

The "82 queued, only 5 new" bug: significant / consent-pending memories were
inserted with no similarity check, so paraphrase duplicates piled up. create()
now folds a near-duplicate into the existing entry instead. These pin that:
near-identical → confirm (no new row, no append); additive near-dup → merge
(append the new detail); distinct → a normal new row.

embed_text is mocked so similarity is deterministic (no model needed).
