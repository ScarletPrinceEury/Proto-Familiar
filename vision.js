/**
 * The provider boundary (vision build spec §3) — the ONE seam where media
 * references become provider content-parts. Nothing else in the repo knows
 * what a given model can look at, which is what makes the design future-proof:
 * a video-capable model is a change here, not a message-format migration.
 *
 * `materializeAttachments(apiMessages, opts)` transforms an assembled API
 * message array: a message carrying `attachments` either gains an `image_url`
 * part per live image (when the connection can see and the image is within the
 * live budget) or has a code-built stand-in appended to its content STRING
 * (otherwise). A message that never carried attachments is returned byte-for-
 * byte unchanged — a non-vision request is exactly the shape it is today.
 *
 * Capability (§3.1): per-connection `visionCapable` tri-state — 'yes'/'no' are
 * the ward's word; 'auto' (default) resolves via a cache keyed `provider:model`
 * (tomes/.vision-capability.json). An uncached 'auto' is treated as
 * OPTIMISTICALLY capable and the real turn serves as the probe: a modality
 * rejection flips the cache to 'no' (mid-turn fallback in server.js), a
 * successful live turn records 'yes'. This beats a synthetic probe image,
 * which would add an LLM call on the first image and break the "zero extra
 * calls" acceptance criterion.

 *   - A false NEGATIVE (a real vision model we don't recognise → treated as

 *     blind model that gets an image it can't parse confabulates its contents.
 *     A tester shared a photo of food and a non-vision primary (GLM) gushed
 *     about the ward's FACE. That is the failure mode.
 *
 * So the list stays TIGHT — it matches only families known to take image parts,
 * and crucially does NOT match text-only siblings that merely share a prefix
 * (GLM's vision models carry a `v` suffix: glm-4v / glm-4.6v — bare glm-4.6 /
 * glm-5.2 are text-only and must NOT match). When in doubt it returns false and
 * the image is described. The ward's explicit `visionCapable:'yes'` and the

// Decisions recorded (their words):
//   • FULL weighting — an image-derived distress signal counts the same as one
//     the ward typed (no damping). REVISIT for people who enjoy fictional
//     violence healthily (horror fans) — full weighting will false-positive on
//     horror imagery, and this wants a context-aware exception later.
//   • RAISE-ONLY — an image can only raise the tier, never lower it. REVISIT
//     for more context-aware picture interpretation (a genuinely calming image
//     de-escalating) once that reading is trustworthy.
//
// This does NOT change crisis-signals.js or threat-tracker.js: it reuses the
// ward's own scorer on the image's DESCRIPTION (the transcribed text + what I
// saw), never the raw model prose, and feeds the delta through the existing
// recordThreat with source:'vision'. Only fires on the ward's OWN image (a
// villager's shared bytes never move the ward's safety state). Gated by the
// caller to the ward's own turn; `scoreFn`/`recordFn` are injectable for tests.
