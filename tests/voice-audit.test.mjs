/**
 * The Pass 1 audit findings, each locked so it cannot come back.
 *
 * My human, after the fourth voice-note bug: "how about you do a full audit of
 * your work on the voice spec so we don't have to hunt down ten more small
 * oversights?" This is what that turned up. Every test below names a real
 * defect that was live in shipped code, found by walking the spec against the
 * source rather than by anyone hitting it.
 *
 * The recurring shape: a function written, tested, documented — and never
 * wired to anything. `installVoice()` was the first. It was not the last.
