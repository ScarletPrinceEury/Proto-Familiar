/**
 * The path from "fresh install" to "my Familiar speaks" must never require a
 * terminal.
 *
 * This project is built for people with executive dysfunction. "Run this
 * command" is where someone stops — my human proved it by having to do every
 * step by hand across a night. Before this, all nine entry points mentioned
 * voice ZERO times, and the download and the sidecar existed only as CLI
 * commands nobody was told about.
 *
 * These assert the WIRING, not the wording. They fail when a step falls out of
 * a launcher or an endpoint loses its caller — which is exactly how
 * `installVoice()` sat for days with tests and no caller at all.
