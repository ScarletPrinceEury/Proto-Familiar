"""Intentions layer (Initiative Pass 3) — a future the Familiar writes for
itself.

A first-class "my intention" object with a what, a why, refs, a trigger, and
an optional condition. The substrate for planning, follow-through, and
*rounds* (phase-bound standing intentions — "every morning I go over the
calendar", "every noon I check in on Chen if we haven't talked in an hour").

Pure functions over a sqlite3.Connection, same shape as schedule.py /
interest.py / handoff.py — trivially unit-testable with an in-memory DB.

Division of labour (deliberate): this module owns STORAGE and TRIGGER
TIMING (is an 'at' time past? is this the intention's phase right now? has
this occurrence already fired?). It does NOT evaluate the `condition`
vocabulary — that gate needs live signals (the ward's contact gap, the needs
ledger, whether a ref is still unresolved) that live on the Node side, so
`intentions_due` returns each due intention WITH its condition attached for
the caller to apply. Keeping the live-signal gate where the signals are is
the "gate in code, near the data" discipline.

Refs are stored as slug ids and NEVER snapshotted — they are dereferenced
fresh whenever the intention surfaces, so a payoff turn reasons over the
current state of the thing, not a stale copy.

Time is LOCAL-naive throughout (the ward's wall-clock, no offset), exactly
like schedule.py — the Familiar writes plain local time and does no tz math.
