"""Unruh MCP server.

Tools exposed (stable contract — Thalamus depends on these shapes):

  Liveness:
    health_check       — boot diagnostic

  Schedule (M3):
    schedule_add_node     — create event / task / phase / state
    schedule_add_edge     — connect two nodes with a causal/temporal kind
    schedule_get_window   — read items in a time window (+ touching edges)
    schedule_resolve      — mark a task/event done/cancelled/carried

  Interest (M4–M5):
    interest_record       — bump engagement weight for a topic
    interest_bookmark     — save a resource against a topic
    interest_set_standing — promote a topic to an always-on standing value
    interest_demote_standing — demote a standing value to a live interest
    interest_list         — list interests by effective (decayed) weight

  Session handoff (M6):
    session_set_handoff           — store a session-end intent + threads
    session_get_handoff           — read the latest (un)consumed handoff
    session_mark_handoff_consumed — stop a surfaced handoff re-appearing

  Briefing (called per-message by Thalamus):
    temporal_context   — assembled handoff + schedule + interests payload

The temporal_context payload always carries all three sub-blocks
(handoff / schedule / interests); empty ones render as nothing so the
formatter in thalamus.js / temporal-format.js stays clean.
