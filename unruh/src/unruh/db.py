"""SQLite connection + migration management for Unruh.

One DB file per Unruh install at `unruh/data/unruh.db`. WAL mode
+ a generous busy_timeout cover the case where two Unruh processes
race (the launchers go to lengths to prevent that, but the
prevention isn't bulletproof; cf. Cross-cutting concerns §10 in
docs/unruh-implementation-plan.md).

Migrations are plain `.sql` files in `migrations/`, named
`NNNN_description.sql`. The current schema version is stored in
`meta.schema_version`. On every connect, any migration with a
number > current version is applied in order inside a transaction.
Idempotent (CREATE IF NOT EXISTS etc.) so partial application
doesn't wedge the DB.
