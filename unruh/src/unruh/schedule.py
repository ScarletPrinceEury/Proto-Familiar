"""Schedule-layer logic — events, tasks, phases, states, and the
edges that connect them.

This is the M3 surface. Pure functions over a sqlite3.Connection so
they're trivial to unit-test in isolation (`get_conn(":memory:")`).
Server-side glue (MCP tool registration, payload shaping) lives in
server.py — keep it thin so the model of "what an Unruh schedule is"
stays in one place.

Node shapes by type:

  type='event'   — fixed appointment. when_ts = start (required),
                   end_ts = end (optional).
  type='task'    — something that needs doing. when_ts = optional
                   deadline; resolution tracks done/cancelled/carried.
  type='phase'   — named time-block in the daily routine. when_ts =
                   start (required, may use today's date templating
                   on read), end_ts = end (required).
  type='state'   — emotional / situational context spanning a window.
                   when_ts = start (required), end_ts = end (optional;
                   open-ended state).

Edge kinds (semantics in the design doc):
  'causes' | 'requires' | 'depends_on' | 'blocks' | 'during' | 'carries_forward'
