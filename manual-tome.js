/**
 * manual-tome.js — the self-documenting "Familiar Manual" tome.
 *
 * A protected, enabled-by-default lorebook whose entries explain the Familiar's
 * features and where to find each setting, keyed to how a ward would ask ("how
 * do I send you pictures"). Entries carry live macros (tome-macros.js) so the
 * state they quote is always current ("Vision is currently {{visionActive}}.").
 * The ward can then ask their Familiar to walk them through the app, and the
 * answer reflects reality instead of a frozen doc.
 *
 * Seeded on boot and AUTO-REFRESHED when MANUAL_TOME_VERSION bumps (flag-tracked
 * with a content hash) — but only when the on-disk manual is still the app's own
 * unedited seed; a ward who deletes or edits it is respected and never overridden.
 * Shipped `enabled: true` + `graduationExempt: true` so Tome Graduation never
 * strips it. Content is reference the Familiar reads and relays in its own voice
 * — kept plain and accurate; where an exact UI label isn't certain it says
 * "in Settings" rather than inventing a path.

Per-connection control is the "Can watch video?" switch in the Connections modal, next to "Can see images?" — set it to Yes for a model I've confirmed can watch. Short clips (up to ~20 MB) ride inline; for a longer clip on a Gemini connection there's a "Watch full clip" button that uploads it and I answer about the whole thing.

 * refresh only when the on-disk file still matches that hash (i.e. the ward

 * version in the flag and stop trying, so a customised manual is never resurrected
 * or overwritten. Writes file-then-flag atomically; never throws (a failure here
 * must not block boot).
 *
 * Migration: a pre-hash flag (seeded before this version, no `contentHash`) is
 * treated as pristine — manual-tome editing was never a surfaced flow before now,
 * so an existing file is by definition the app's own untouched seed and is
 * refreshed. Going forward, the hash protects real ward edits.
