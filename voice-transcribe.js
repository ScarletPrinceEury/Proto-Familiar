/**
 * Listening to a voice note, once (voice spec §9).
 *
 * The exact shape of `describeAsset` in vision.js, in the register of hearing:
 * I listen to a recording one time, and what was said is cached on the asset
 * forever. Everything downstream — the stand-in, memorization, search, the
 * meaning-bearing slug — reads that cached text rather than the audio, which
 * is why a transcript outlives the bytes it came from.
 *
 * ── Why the transcript sits in `description` ────────────────────────────
 * Not a shortcut: it is the same slot for the same reason. `description` is
 * "the words I have for this thing" — everything that consumes it (the
 * stand-in builder, the slug graduation, memorization's fold) already treats
 * it that way and needed no change to hold a transcript. Giving audio its own
 * parallel field would have meant teaching every one of those consumers about
 * a second place to look.
 *
 * ── Pressing the button IS the consent ──────────────────────────────────
 * Voice notes consult ONLY `PROTO_FAMILIAR_VOICE_DISABLED`. Do not put
 * `voiceEnabled` back in front of them: it gated them once, which hid the
 * button and so hid the feature, and a deliberate press already carries the
 * browser's own permission prompt.
 *
 * `voiceEnabled` is for CONTINUOUS listening (live calls, Pass 2) — a mic
 * left open is a different thing and does need an explicit opt-in.
 *
 * ── It never throws ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every caller is a chat path. A missing model, a dead worker, an unreadable
 * file — each becomes a recorded reason and a stand-in that says so. An
 * absent transcript renders as absence; it does not 500 a turn.
